§ 2. ambactos cluentes οε. The exact meaning of ambacu,
which was a Gallie wor ,is not certain. According to Festus,
a lexicographer of the sixth century (De siynfficationa verborum,
ed. Mfiller, 1839,p .,4) ambactus apud Ennium Gallica linqua
smdust‘lszpeuatgr’ mccl} 1 take tod ιιέεαιιιέ-,ὴαίῇἔὴθ 110011, Enntiltlis
use e wor a ι ns, earne e mans rom e
Cisalpine Gaula, in the sense of servus. But if the ambacei
whom Caesar mentions had been slaves, he would have written
not ambactos, but servom so, if Ennius was right, semus, as the
equivalent of ambactns, clearly means, not a slave, but a paid
servant; and this is the meaning which Mommsen (1112, r, 1895,
p. 20, note) attaches to ambactus: that is to say, he regards
ambacu· as retainers inferior in rank to clientes, who held an
honourable position, like that of the armed retaiuers of
mediaeval barone. ln a later p (,19 §4> Caesar distin-

uishes between servi and clientes. 1180τέ01113 Gallie fanen-ale,

along with them after the conclusion of the regular obsequies ’
(paulo supra hanc memoriam servi et clientes quos ab iis dilectos
esse constabat iustis funebm‘bus conlfecte’s una amabantur). I
believe that servi here means ⁴ s aves ', but I am not quite
sure that it does not mean ‘paid servants’, that is ambactae'.
Some writeis think that in the passage which this note is
intended to ex plain clientesque was added by Caesar as the
equivalent of ambactos, so that ambactos clientesque meant‘ am-
baete, that is to say, clients' 3but if he had intended to con·

then, to elieve that ambactua though it was of Gallie orig in,
had become an established Latin word, which his Italian readers
understood (C. G„ Ρ). 514-16).

16, §L omnis is iiere used as in i, 1, ξ 1 (Gallia est munis
divisa, &c. ), and its position shows that it means ‘as a whole '.
