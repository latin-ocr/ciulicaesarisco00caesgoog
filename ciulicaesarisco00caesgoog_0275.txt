Caesar almost always uses the indicative with cum to express
repeated action: but Meusel (J. B„ 1894, p. 371) holds that

with Caesar. I infer from the narrative that the embass of
the 'l'rinovantes was dispatched before Caesar had advance far
into the interior, and doubtless as soon as he had proved his
superiority. As the Trinovantes were evidently antagonistic to
the Catuvellauni—the tribe over whom Cassivellaunus ruled—
we may be sure that if they had been forced to join the league
