4. eas civitates . . . pacaverat. It has been suad that tlns is
a eliberate exaggeration, because Caesar tells us himself in
another passage (ιν, 16, 5) that of all the tribes east of the
Rhine the Ubi1 alone ha sent envoys to him. But the critice
forget that in a later chapter (iv, 18, § 3) he says that when he

ξ 5. Εοπηξιθαάυεηιιι. Where did the German cavalry join
Caesar? Evidently somewhere in the country of the Lingones
ί see p. 422). Some weeks must have passed since Caesar rejoined
Labienus (62, ᾗ lo): for in the interval he had time to send
across the Rhme for reinforcements and to receive them:
a council of representatives from almost all the Gallie tribes
was convencd and met (63, §§ 5-6); and Vercingetorix, after
he had been elected commander·in·chief by this council
(63, 6), had time to raiae new troops and to send them to
attac the Province (64). During the interval Caesar's soldiers
doubtless tested, and he laid in a fresh stock of provisions.
