not only ‘of the over cliffs, ut also of the heights whic
hemmed in the old harbour of Dover on either side. It seems
to me just possible that απριιειίε may here mean‘ nan-ow ’and
therefore‘ precipitous’; for if a mountain 1s relatively narrow,
it must needs be relatively precipitous. By a narrow mountain

§g4. ad horam nonam means ‘to the end of the ninth hour‘

ut cum. The MS. reading, ut quam, is meanin g;less and
accordingly Lipsius proposed ιιι quae, equivalent to iquippe quae,
which emendation has been generally accepted. 1't ιε n g‚ht
administrarentur is used without ιιι. The emendation which
1 have adopted was suggested by Mommsen.

Walmer Castle and Deal Castle.1 have proved this in A. B.

p. 595-665): here it will of course be impossible to do more
tssan give a bare outline. Several other sites had been pro-
posed; 8¹but the only ones of which the reader need take account
are Pevensey, Lym*y ne, and Hy the.

Any one who un erstood the yconditions of ancient warfare and
had exp lored the coast of Kent and Sussex, or even studied the
Ordnance Map, would at once perceive that Caesar must have
lauded in East Kent, where the country behind the foreshore
was open and he could encounter the enemy on equal terms.
If he had attempted to disembark at Lympne or Hythe‚ he
would have been obliged to force his way inland over a line
of heights‚ whereas ιιι those days no good general ever attacked
an enemy who occupied a commanding osition, if he could
avoid doing so. if he had attempted to and at Pevensey or
any where west of Lympne, he would have abeen confronted by
the forest of the Weald.
