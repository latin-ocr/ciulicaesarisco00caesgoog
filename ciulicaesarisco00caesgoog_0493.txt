conveniensque superiori facto, Nam (M.) Marcellus
proximo ann0, cum impugnaret Caesaris dignitatem,
contra legem Pompei et Crassi retulerat ante tempus
ad senatum de Caesaris provinciis, sententiisque dictis

pollicitus here means ‘offered' or ‘proposed ’. It is never
used with a subjunctive in Caesar; but Hirtius's usage is per-
haps justifiable‚ for the subjunctives discederet and dimitteret are
what is called 'ussive.

minimum. eusel adopts Kiibler's emendation, minorem,
which is certainly better; but I am not sure that Hirtius
wrote it.

foro means the pso le congregated in the Forum,—ths heart
of the political, legaR and commercial life of Rome. So one
might say ‘the Stock Exchange ’, meaning ‘the members of the
Stock Exchange ⁹.

ξ 5. discessionem‚—a ‘division ', in the sense in which the word
is familiar to all who read repoits of parliamentary debates.
The senators in voting passed to different sides of the house,
just as members of Parliament go into different lobbies.

evicerunt was proposed by Madvig instead of the unsatis-
factory MS. reading, iusserunt.

ἠἐίιῖεηιι . . . provinciis. Marcellus had brought forward this
motion in 51 Β. 0., and as under the Iex Pompeia Licinia Caesar
was to retain his province until March 1, 49 Β. c., the action of
Marcellus was premature. Indeed, a letter written by Caelius
to Cicero (Fam, viii, 8, 9) shows that a clause in the law
forbade the Senate to ‘scuss the appointment of Caesar’s
successor before March 1, 50 (C. G„ pp. 832-3).
