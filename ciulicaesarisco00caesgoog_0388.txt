certain cohorte of the four legions which Cacsar sent on were
‘ picked out’ in order that they might be rearranged and the four
legions might look like six; but after a careful examination of
the Thesaurus linquae Latinae (iii, 335 Ι can only conclude that

factory. Car-ptis quibusdam cohortibus would mean ‘breaking
up certain cohorts' (into their constituent parts, namely
maniples); and if Caesar wrote this, we might suppose that
three of the four legions marched in their usual formation,
while the 10 cohorts of the remaining one were broken up into
their 30 maniples, each of which was so extended that. seen
from a considerable distance, it might be taken for a cohort.
But it is doubtful whether carpo could be used in the sense
of discerpe unless it were joined with in (partes, &c.). 1 have
therefore not attempted to amend the passage (Ο. G.. p . 751-4).
ᾗ 4. pontem reficere coepit. A road must have leg to this
bnd e; and as Caesar came from Decize (Decetia), we may
conc ude that it was either at Moulins, or at Varennes‚ or at
Vichy. Caesar reached Gergovia from the bridge in five
marches. Vichy is only about 33 miles from Gergovia, and
must therefore be rejected. Probably the army began its march
not at Decize‚ but at Nevers (Noviodunum), where, as we learn
from 55, §§ 1-3‚ Caesar established an important depot; and if
s0‚ it may have crossed the Allier at Moulins. But Gaesar's
remark (35, ξ l) that ‘ patrols were thrown out to prevent the
Romans from making a bridge' suggests that 116 had been
obli ed to pass one of the broken bndges‚ and therefore that
the ridge which he repaired was at varennes. This town is
only about 48 miles from Ger via: but the first of the five
marshes may have been short, ecause four of the legions had
done double work on the previous day3 and so may the last,
because Caesar perhaps reached Gergovia early (Ο. G„ p . 754—5).
