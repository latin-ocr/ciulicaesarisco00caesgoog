X V nullium is certainly wrong; for to construet a contra-
vallation 15 Roman miles in extent round either Namur or
Mont Falhize, with one or the other of which the oppidum must
be identified, would have been sheer folly. The reading of a·—
vallo pedum in circuitu XV milium—will not do either3 for
{jaceat ιιενοέθιξοῧοηοᾶ miles in terms of feet. Possibly he wrote V

castellii. See 33, §3 and the note on i, 8, ξ 2.

circummuniti means ‘ shut in’. cf. B. 0., i, 81, § 5; 84, ξ 4.

ξ 3. αρρενε extructo. The word aqyer is here used in the sense
of an oblon mound or terrace, such as was commonly con·
structed by reeks, Romans, and Asiatics in besieging fortified
towns. We shall see presently what pu ose it was intended
to serve. Before the construction of suc a mound could be
b un, the ground u on which it was to be erected had generally
to e levelled, or, i it was too steep or broken to be reduced
to one plane surface, it was perhaps levelled in step-like sections;
and this was done by men working under the cover of a sapper's
hut (B. 0., ii, 2, ξ 4). The ayyer was made lar ly, if not maml ,
of wood‚—the lightest snitable material ς whi e earth and rubb e
were used to fill up interstices and to make the structure com·
pact. The woodwork consisted of loqs, piled in layers‚ the logs
1n each layer being laid at right ang es with those in the layer
below. When, as at Avaricum (vii, 24, 1), the ayqer was very
large, this elaborately constructed woo work probably servecl
only as a wall on either side, to prevent the more loosely
heaped interior from scattering. The workmen were protected
from the enemy’s missiles by sheds called vineae (see the note
on 12, ᾗ 3). The evidence for this description will be found in
B. 0., i1, 2, ξ 4; Thucydides, ii, 75 ; Lucan, iii, 394—8, 4553
Ap ian, mehr„ 303 and Silius Italicus, xiii, 109-10.

n vii, 22, ξ 5 Caesar says that during the siege of Avaricum the
Gauls endeavoured to prevent the Romans from bringing their
cuniculi up to the walls (a ertos cuniculos. . . morabanturmoeni-
busque ad ropinquarepmh' ebant); and aecor-din ly some writers
believe t t there were galleries in the ayyer. he passage will
be considered in the right place, but cuniculos can only mean
subterranean galleries‚ or mines. The ayyerwas certainly solid ;
for there is direct evidence that some ayyeres were (Thucydides,
ii, 75, § 23 Lucan, iii, 394-8); the only use of making leries
would have been to save material; and the gain wou d have
been more than counterbalaneed by the enormous increase of
labour that would have been entailed by making such an aqyer
strong enough to carry the host of soldiers, the sap ers’ huts‚
and the huge towers that stood upon it. Indee , without
bricks it could not have been built.
