THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL

Evssnvssonv knows the three sentences with which
Caesar’s narrative of the Gallie war begins: ‘ Gaul, taken
as a whole, is divided into three partS, one of which is
inhabited by the Belgae, another by the Aquitani, and
the third by a people who call themselves Celts and
whom we call Gauls. These peoples differ from one
another in language‚ institutions, and laws. The Gauls
are separated from the Aquitani by the Garonne‚ from
the Belgae by the Marne and the Seine.’ This informa·
tion was enough for Gaesar’s Italian readerst he did not
trouble himself or them about the races which had in-
habited Gaul long before Gauls and Belgae arrived, and
whose descendants lived there still; and if we had to
depend upon him alone, we should know no more about
the ethnology of Gaul than the man in the street knows
about the ethnology of Britain, where the descendants of
HuguenotS, Flemings, Jews, Normans, DaneS‚ Saxone,
Celts, and aborigines are living now under the common
name of Englishmen. A century ago the most learned
men knew very little more than what Caesar told them.
But within the last generation or two a great deal more
has been ascertained,—mostly from evidence which was
not to be found in books, Here 1 need only give a shore
explanation of the way in which the information has
been acquired and a short statement of the results.

The information has been derived from four different
sourcesf-the evidence of Caesar and other ancient writers
and the three sciences, which are steadily growing, called η
physica] anthropology, archaeology‚ and philology. The ἶ
anthropologists have worked in t-wo different ways ε they
have carefully measured skeletons or skulls found in
caverns‚ in ancient graves, and elsewhere, and belonging
to men who were living in Gaul not only after the Celtic
invasion (see p. xlvii) but many hundreds or thousands α’
years before Caesar set soot in the country, and have
