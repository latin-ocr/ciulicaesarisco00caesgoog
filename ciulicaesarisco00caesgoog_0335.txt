COMMENTARIUS VI 253

Ac fuit antea tempus, cum Germanos Galli virtute 24 Gaulo

superarent, ultro bella inferrent, propter hominum
multitudinem agrique inopiam trans Rhenum colonias·

mitterent. Itaque ea quae fertilissima Germaniae 2

sunt loca circum Hercyniam silvam, quam Erato-
stheni et quibusdam Graecis fama notam esse video,
quam illi Orcyniam appellant, Volcae Tectosages

occupaverunt atque ibi consederunt; quae gens ad 3

hoc tempus his sedibus sese continet summamque

quod in eadem inopia, egestate, patientia qua (ante)
Germani permanent, eodem victu et cultu corporis

utuntur, Gallis autem provinciarum propinquitas et 5

transmarinarum rerum notitia multa ad copiam atquc

usus largitur, paulatim adsuefacti superari multisque 6

24,§ 1. Every one who is familiar with Latin literature would
missAc here if it were absent: a particle of transitionis necessary,
though Ceterum mi ht have been used instead, showin that the
writer, having finisffied his survey of the manners ang customs
of the Gauls and Germans, is passmg on to notice the former
relations between the two peo les. But every one who has
a feeling for style would be o ended by a translation of Ac:
if Caesar could have written in English, he would have said
merely ⁶ Once there was a time ⁹, διο.

cum . . . superarent. Even in this passage cum does not tell
us only ‘how one action is related to another with regard to the
time of its occurrence ’ (see the note on 1, 4, ξ 3). 'Phe meaning
is (Once there was a time) ‘when Gauls were [so brave that
they were] more warlike than Germans’. But in English the
words enclosed in square brackets must be omitted, and lest to
the imagination. See the first note on 1, 23, ξ 1.

§ 2. Hercyniam silvam. Judging from 25, ξ 1 (which was
probably not written by caesar), the Hercynian forest com·
prised the whole Danubian region from the source of the
Danube to the Carpathians. ,

Eratosthenes was an Alexandrian geographer and poet, who
lived in the third century Β. c.

ξ 4. ante was supplied b Η. J. Heller. If it were omitted, the
subject of permanent wo d be Galli or Volcae Tectos ee, which
is evidently impossible. The insertion of ante wou d be un-
necessary if we could read quoque, which is found in S, instead
ofqaecod, and put a full stop after natantum but to critical readers
this expedient will not commend itself.

ξ 5. provae'nce'amm means the provinces of Transalpine and
Cisalpine Gaul. See the map and p. lxii.
