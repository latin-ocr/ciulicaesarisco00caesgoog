another consul in the Province. Then they vanished :

but four years later they reappeared; and two more

armies were routed on the banks of the Rhone. The 105 ac.

panio-stricken Italians dreaded another Allia: but, while

Italy lay at their mercy, the Cimbri turned aside; and

when, after three years' wandering in Spain and Gaul,

they rejoined the Teutoni, and the two swarms headed

for the south, Marius was waiting for them on the Rhone,

and his brother consul in Cisalpine Gaul. Once more

the host divided3 and while the Teutoni encountered

Marius, the Cimbri threaded the Brenner Pass, and

His aim was not merely ⁸to get rid of Ariovistus and to

free his country from the yoke of the Sequani, but also

to regain his own influence, which had been eclipsed by

that of his younger brother, Dumnorix. He was treated

with marked distinction, made the acquaintance of

Caesar, and discussed religion and philosophy with Cicero ς
