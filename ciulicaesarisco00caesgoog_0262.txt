litore . . . aperio means ‘a nice open shore ’. Mollis denotes
a shore where the anchorago was good, and where the shi
if they were driven eund, would suffer comparatively litt e.
I do not think that chneider is right in arguinffi that mollis
should be translated b ‘ gently slo mg ⁹, though at meaning
is doubtless implied. rofessor J. . Postgate, who agrees with
ιιιὲ, ξειιεέξίιιᾶὶγ referred me to a passage in Ovid (Ep. ex Ponto,
1, , - —
Cum subit Aumoeti quae sit clementia, eredo
Mollia naufiuqiis litora posse dari—
which seems to 'ustify my e lanation. Professor Postgate
remarks that whi e aperio deseri es the approach to the shore,
which was not blocked by rocks, mollis connotes both a gentle
slope and a soft surfaee (A.B., pp. 628-30). Caesar, m his
anxiety to march against the Britons, took the risk of not haulin
his shi s up on shore, an operation which would have consum
valuab e time. See the note on loco . . . capto. But he made
a mistake‚ which eost him dear. See ch. 10-11.

W mer and andwich, the river behind which the Britons
were posted must have been either the Great Stour or the
Little Stour. The Little Stour above Bekesbourne is now
generally dry; but after prolon ed heavy rains there may be
plenty of water. In May, 1902, walked 'along the bank, and
, there was not a teaspoonful in the channel: in April, 1904, the
stream was running strongly past Barham. It may therefore
have been a flumen in 54 Β. G„ though we must not forget that
both in 55 and 54 the summer, at all events in Gaul, was excep-
tionally dry (iv, 38, 23 v, 24, ξ l). Nevertheless Caesar did
not encounter the ritons on the Little Stour. The locue
superior which he mentions was either the left bank of the
stream or hi h ground near the lest bank. Now even at
Bekesbourne t e dry channel of the Little Stour is only about
two feet deep3 and although there are well-defined heights on
the left bank between Barham and Bridge‚ the lowest slopcs,
except opposite Kingston and for a short space on either side
of it, are at a considerable distance from the channel. If
