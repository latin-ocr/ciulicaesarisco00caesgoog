8, ξ 1. murum . . . perducit. Caesar’s deseri tion, as Colonel
Stoffel pointed out aster he had examine t e banks of the
Rhene between Geneva and the Pas de l’ cluse, is not to be
understood literally. Evidently he threw up earthworks only
in the places where the bank was not so steep as to form a natural
fortificatiom and Dion Cassius (xxxviii, 31, 4), who says that
he fortified the most important points, had t e wit to perceive
his meaning. Some commentatore, indeed, have insisted that
a continuone rampart would have been a better protection.
But how could the Helvetii have climbed the banks, where they
were precipitous, with their wagons ‘? And, supposing that
some of them had climbed without their wagons‚ they would
also have been able to climb the assumed rampart unless Roman
soldiers had been there to defend it3 while if they had been
there, the bank would have served as a natural rampart. Caesar
was not writi a treatise for military engineers, but a popular
narrative; an he expressed himself loosely (0. G„ pp.614-15).

ξ 2. praesidia here would be best translated by ‘ piquets '.

castella‚-redoubts constructed at intervals along the line of
earthworks, and garrisoned by piquets (praesidia).

conentur. 'l'he MS. reading is concamium but, as Meuscl
shows (J. Β., 1894, p. 356), after the historic present, communit,
the present, possit, which is found in απ, accords with Caesar's
usage in final relative clauses, and if he wrote it, not posset,
which occurs only in ρ, he must also have written conantur.

ῗ 4. Helvetii . . . conati. These attacks were doubtless made
on y by impatient isolated hands. The Helvetian commander
(see 13, ξ 2) would not have sanctioned such folly.
