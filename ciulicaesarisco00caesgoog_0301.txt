Greek characters '. Dion Cassius (xl, 9, ξ 3) says that the letter
was written in Greek: but his testimony on such a point
proves nothin ς and if Caesar had meant what Dion sup-
posed, he wou d have said Graece. He uses the expression
Gmecis litteris in two other passages (i, 29, ξ 1 and vi, 14, ξ 3),
where the meaning ‘Greek characters' is indisputable. He
wrote the letter in Latin but in Greek characters, just as
officers in the Indian Mutiny sometimes wrote dispatches in
Greek characters. This passage proves that some of the Nervii
or their allies understood Latin (C. G„ pp. 730-1).

§5. An ammentum was a thong‚ fastened to the middle of
a javelin, to enable it to be thrown with greater force. As Long
explains (D. R. R.. iv, 228), referring to Ovid's Metamorphoses,

native to throw his spear extraordinarily far. have myself’,
