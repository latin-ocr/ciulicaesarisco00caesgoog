THE TEXT OF THE ΟΟΜΜΕΝΤΑΙίΙΕιὸ1 xiii

Professor A. Klotz (Rheinisches Muscam, 1910, pp. 224-
34) thinks that the foregoing pedigree, which has been
generally accepted, is incorrect. He believes, with Pro·
sessor B. Kubler, that the archetype of all the extant
MSS. was a copy belonging to β, and that α is descended
from a copy belonging to the same group, in which read·
ings from a manuscript of the sixth century, published
by two editors—Julius Celsus Constantinus and Flavius
Licerius Firminus Lupicinus —were inserted. Accord-
ingly Klotz has constructed this pedigree, which, in the
opinion of Meusel (Jahresberichte des philoloqioehen Vereins
ιιι Berlin, 1912, pp. 18-21), may possibly be right :—

ωᾱααεῶι· enacim

s}

'l'he two groups, α and β, differ from each other about
1,500 times; and an editor cannot do without either.
But when they differ and neither is obviously wrong,
how is he to decide between them? Simply, in most
cases, by considering the context or by carefully noting
Caesar's use of language in passages in which the two
groups agree. This laborious task has been performed
by various critics, notably by three German scholarS,
Rudolf Schneider, Meusel, and Alfred Klotz. Let me
give one or two examples. In v, 35, ξ 5 α has (cum
a prima luce ad horam octavam) pugnantum β has
puynassent. 'Phe former is preferable because Caesar in
describing the duration of a battle almost always uses
the passive. In vii, 64, §2 ah have (peditatu quem
ante) habuerat (se fore contentum dicit); while the rest
of the β MSS. have habuerit, which is certainly right,
because the relative clause is part of what Vercingetorix
said, and therefore the subjunctive is necessary. But in
some cases the claims of α and β appear to be equally
balanced ; and here, sor reasons which Ι have given in the
Classical Review of 1901 (p. 175), I follow with Meusel
the reading of α.
