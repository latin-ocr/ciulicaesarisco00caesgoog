Allier and the Loire, stands u n ground which is better

(2) ancerre, on the left bank of the Loire, about 30 miles
north by west of Nevers, is also a very strong position. lts
earliest known name was Castrum Gotdom’cum, and if Caesar
wrote θοήοηα, which is found in the β MSS, it is more than
likely that the stronghold of the Boi was Sancerre. But San·

Goler and of M. Ju , who supposes that the site of the
stronghold was the rising ground on which the chnrch now
stands. I do not ee w1th them, because, as 1 have already
argued, it is unEke y that the Boi had any territory except in
the peninsula formed by the Allier and the Loire. 1 have,
therefore, marked Gorgobina on the map on the site of St. Par-ize-
leOhatel, but with a note of interrogation (0. G„ pp. 425-30).

Graioceli. —This tribe, as the name shows, inhabited the
Graian Alps. Where was their town, Ocelum? Caesar (i, 10,

5) passed through it when he was returninffifmm Italy to

Gaul, and that he marc ed thence into the country of the
Vocontii (q.v.) in 7 days. He crossed the Alps by way of Hont
Genevre (see the note on 10, ἐξ 3-5), and in order to reach the
pass he must have moved along the river Dora Riparia. Accord-
mg to Strabo (iv, l, ξ 3), Ocelum was 99 Roman miles from
Epeprodunum (Embrun); and, within a mile or two, this is
the distance from Embrun, along the Roman read which ran

ast Brigantio (Briancon) and over Mont Genevre to Avigliana.

our vases, on each of which an itinerary is inscribed. have
been discovered at Bagni di Vicarello: three of them place
Ocelum at 20 Roman miles from Turin, and two of them at the
same distance from Susa. These figures nearly correspond with
the actual distances of Avigliana and of Drubiaglio from Turin
and from Susa respectively, Drubiaglio being on the northern.

Rifaria. Accor in to the fourth vase, there was a station

osAntom'nc (p. 341) gives 18 Roman miles as the distance, and
in another passage (pp. 356-7) 16. An inscription, containing
the words trunsum cor'r1—‘ on the frontier of Cottius ⁹—has
been found at Dru iagli03 and Strabo (iv, 1, ξ 3) mys that
Ocelum was the boundary of Cottius’s kingdom. The inscrip—
tion proves that at a town which stood upon the site of Avigliam
