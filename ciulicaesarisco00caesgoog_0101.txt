But althou h the battle-field is certain, opinions differ about
details. Sto el believed that the hill to which the Helvetii fell
back after the failure os their first attack (25, ξ 5)wasjust north
of the vill 6 of Montmort; but, as the plan (180111ςὲ 25) will
show, in 0 er to maintain this view, he was oblige to ar ue
that the Boi and Tulingi attacked the Romans on their est
flank, whereas Caesar says that they attached them on the right

see the note on 25, 6). Besides, according 10 Stoffel, in the
rst of the batt e, while the 6 hting was going on 011 1116
11111 of ecy, 1116 extremity of t e Roman right wing was
posted on a steep declivity‚ whereas the Romans referred a
entle slope. Colonel Bircher therefore modified Sto el’s theory.

6 concluded that the four veteran Roman legions(24, ξ 2) were
posted 011 1116 lower slopes of Armecy, facing west-south-west,
aud that 1116 11111 to which the Helvetii retreated was on the
further side of the valley through which runs the road from
Toulon-sur-Arroux 10 Luzy. This was the road by which the
Boi and Tulingi would have marched to reinforce the Helvetii.
Both Stoffel's theo and Bircher's are illustrated in the plan ;
but Captain G. Veit and M. Jullian agree with me in following
Bircher (C. G„ pp. 624-7).

The thei'ughtsul render wiligprobably ω’ fmseif certain
questions, which are suggested by Caesar’s account of the battle
with the Helvetii, but which he does not answer, I sup se
because 116 wrote for his contemporaries, most of whom perffips
knew eno h about wal-fare to understand his book. The
soldiers in t 6 front rank of the fighting line must have become
tired after, say,twent minutos of hand-tohand fighting. How
were they relieved? en and how did the second line come
into action? What was the use os the third line ⁴? The first
question and the last can be answered easily. When the sore-
most ranks became tired, or thinned by the loss of individual
soldier-s, the rear ranks advanced between the 6168 of those in
front, and relieved them. Su erintendent Froest tells me that
this method would be ado te by the police in street fighting;
and indeed no other met od appears practicable. The third
