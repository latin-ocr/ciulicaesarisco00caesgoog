HOW AND WHEN CAESAR WROTE
THE COMMENTARIES

Tm: Commentaries on the Gallie War were published
not later than 46 ns„ for Cicero notices them with admi-
ration in his Brutus (¹75, ξ 262), which appeared in that
year. Most probably indeed they were both written and
published seyeral years earlier; for it is more than un-
likely that Caesar would have had time for literary com·
position during the intense labour of the civil war, and
moreover, as Mommsen says (Hist. of Rome, v, 1894,
p. 499), the book was doubtless intended [at least in part]
to justify before the Roman public what Caesar had done
in Gaul. Ι will explain this in discussing the trust-
worthiness of the narrative.

There are two main‘theories about the way in which
Caesar composed his book. Some critics believe that he
wrote each commentary year by year, after the campaign
which it described ε others that he wrote the whole seven
—for it must be remembered that the eighth was written
by his friend, Aulus Hirtius—in the winter of 52—51 Β. c,
or in the year 50. 'rho latter view is supported by Hir-
tius, who says (Praef.‚ ξ 6), ceteri enim quam bene atque >
emendate, nos etiam quam facile atque celeriter eos perfecerit
scimus (‘ others know the flawless excellence of his work 3
I know more-how easily and rapidly it was done '). If
this remark is not absolutely inconsistent with the sup·
position that each commentary was written in the winter
that followed the campaign which it described, the
natural meaning is that the whole was the result of one
continuous effort. 'I'he statement of Hirtius, who was
one of Caesar’s most intimate friends, and probably also
his literary secretary, is the only original testimony that
we have, and must be accepted unless it can be shown to
be inconsistent with facts. Some critics think that it is.
In ii, 28, ξ 1 we read that ‘ the Nervian people . . . was
brought to the verge of extinction ⁹, whereas in v, 39-42
