explained in ξ 2, extended only across the plain of Les Laumes

re na e.

p ugeius fossae . . . distarent is bracketed by Meusel as absolutely
superfluous (J. Β., 1910, p. 39). Superfluous the words certainly
are,—to a logical mind; but Caesar, like Macaulay, wrote for
dull as well as for intelligent readers, aud he had a passion
for making his meaning strikinyly clear. Remembenng the
Interea, dum haec ‹yet-tantm· of 66, § 1, 1 am not so sure as
Meusel 3· and 1 only bracket the words because the reading
os a—(ut eius) fossae (solum tantundem pateret quantum)
summae fossae labra distarent— differs so much from that of β
as to suggest that there was an interpolation.

ξ 2. passibua The reading of a is pedes, of β pedibus. The
real distance varied at different points, but was everywhere
much more than 400 feet; and the results of Stoffel’s excava-
tions, as shown in the plan facing p. 839, justify us in concluding
that Caesar meant to write aasabim, though he may have written
pedibus b a slip (C. G.. p. 08).

ὀᾶ is a most certainly spurious. Caesar, as Meusel remarks
(J. Β., 1910, p. 60), regularly writes eo (or hoc consilio imme-
diately after the verb ; and, moreover‚ the wor s hoc consilio-
ne . . . posset evidently refer not only to ’diquas . . . reduxit
(ξ 2) but also to Fossam . . . duxit( 1), whereas, if id were
genuine, they could only refer to the omer. ¹ .'
