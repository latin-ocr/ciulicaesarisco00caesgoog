being future to a past tense. . . . Accordingly I should
render “ And though they were to cast anchor, still since
in that case they would fill, these latter, as their only
resource, standing to sea even in the face of night, headed
for the continent ”.’

Can the reader follow ur. Wightman’s argument? He
asserts that the transports ⁴ had been caught by a gale . . .
on a lee shore. What ’, he asks, ⁶ was to be done Ῥ Two
courses of action were open—to cast anchor, or to put to
sea ’. Mr. Wightman says that they did not cast anchor ε
therefore he evidently means that they put to sea. Ger-
tainly they put to sea,—‘ in the face of night’ 3 but,
whether they anchored or not, before they put to sea ‘ they
were swept down mayno suo oum periculo towards the lower
and more westerly part of the island ’. Evidently, then,
when they stood out to sea ‘in the face of night ’ they were
‘forced to close-haul from a point just so much further
dead to leeward’‚ and the shipmasters had ‘ put themselves
in a position which, as regards laying their course back
to the continent, was much worse than that they occupied
when it came on to blow '. But, 1 repeat, since they were

‘ danger point to leeward' within 3,000 miles. What, then,
was this ‘ danger point to leeward’ *Ρ What was the ‘lee
shore ’ ⁶? We have seen that, if it existed at all, it could
only have been East Kent. But Mt. Wightman will
hardly maintain that East Kent was ‘the more westerly
part of the island ' or that the shipmasters would have
been mad enough to let the ships drift towards East Kent
even for one minute. If the wind had blown them towards
that ⁴ danger point ’, they would immediately ha've acted
like their comrades of ‘ the other group ’ and made for the
continent.

Cassan’s description of the manners and customs of the
Germans is perhaps not altogether trustworthy: for he
only spent a few weeks in Germany, never moving far
from the Rhine; we may suppose that he depended for
information principally upon Gallio traders (i, 39, ξ 1),
though he may have learned something from the friendly
Ubii 3 and it would seem that he ascribed to the Ger-mans
