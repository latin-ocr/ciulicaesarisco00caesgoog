army watched it were the heights of St. Gildas. M. J anian, on
the other hand, who maintalns that Caesar penetrated into
Venetia not from the south but from the north of the gulf of'
the Morbihan, thinks that he watched the battle from the
peninsula of Locmariaquer ; and he suggests that the Venetian
fleet may have put out to sea from Port Nava10,—a roadstead
off the peninsula of Sarzeau and between St. Gildas and Loc-
mariaquer. It will be seen that M. J ullian's view differs from
Napoleon’s only in details. No certain decision, as he acknow-

have cut himself off from them by marching far away from the
Loire in order to enter Venetia from the north.

Some writers have argued that in Caesar's time the gulf of
the Morbihan did not exist, and therefore that the theatre of
the war must have been somewhere else. The evidence which
they offer is that flint knives have been found in a part of the
bed of the gulf which is never exposed even at the lowest tide.
Now it is quite true that this coast has undergone subsidence.
Any tout-ist can verify the fact for himself. There are two
stone circles on the islet of Er-Lamic, one of which is only
visible when the tide is exceptionally low. But this does not
prove that the gulf did not exist in 56 Β. o. The flint knives
and the stone c1rcles were probably 2,000 years old or more,
even in Caesar-’s time. Obv10usly the facts are consistent with
the supposition that some of the islands which now stud the
surface of the gulf were then headlands, insulated at high
tide. The promontories which Caesar described ί 12, ᾗ 1) have

Caesar explains the unfamiliar Greek word by tran uillitas.
But why did he not write tranquillitas alone? Per aps, as
Lon says, because malacia seemed to him more expressive. One
mig t, 1 think, translate malacia ac tranquillitas by ‘ a dead calm’.
