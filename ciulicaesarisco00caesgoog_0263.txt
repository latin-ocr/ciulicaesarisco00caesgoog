COMMENTARIUS V 181

quern domestici belli, ut videbatur, causa iam ante
praeparaverant: nam crebris arboribus succisis omnes 5
introitus erant praeclusi. Ipsi ex silvis rari pro- 6
pugnabant nostrosque intra munitiones ingredi pro·
5 bibebant. At milites legionis VII., testudine facta 7
et aggere ad munitiones adiectO, locum ceperunt
eosque ex silvis expulerunt paucis vulneribus acceptis.
Sed eos fugientes longius Caesar prosequi vetuit, et 8
quod loci naturam ignorabat et quod magna parte

10 diei consumpta munitioni castrorum tempus relinqui
volebat.

Caesar had crossed (as Colonel Stoffel believed) at or near
Kingston, the Britons could have opposed him more effectually
when he was ascending Barbam Downs than by attem ting ιο
defend the passage of the rivulet. And since he woul in any
case be obli ed to cross the Great Stour, is it not obvious that
they would ave waited for him behind the river, which might
fairly be called an obstacle, rather than on the banks of the
streamlet, which an active lad could have jumped‘? If, as I
believe, he marched along the line of the Roman road from
Sandwich ιο Canterbury, he crossed the Little Stour at Little·
hearne, where it is wider: but Littlebourne is barel 9 miles
from Sandwich; and Caesar had marched about 1 Roman
miles when he first saw the British troops. Deal is about
this distance from Littlebourne3 but in the note on ξ 1 I have
{3522 {Ssffiffsszsfffffgans ss22‘132232212h3ffl320z‘32td 8⁸50ssss
near Littlebourne there is no trace of a Bnt1sh camp.

The Great Stour, below Fordwich‚ would have been impassable
in Caesar's time in the face of an enemy; for it flowed through
a broad moi-ass. It appears to me that he must have crossed it
either between Fordwich and Sturry, or in the neighbourhood
os 'Phanin n, just above Canterhnry, or possibly at Canterbury
itself ; an Ι am sure that any one who will earefully examine
the ground will agree with me. The stronghold to which the
Britons retreated was probably a camp in Bigbury woods, about
a mile and a half west of Canterbury, of which traces still exist3
and it therefore seems most likely that Caesar forced the

§6.'1¹›³11·'0pu9nabant‚ cou led with ex silone, implies that the
scattered groups fought y throwing missiles. cf. vii, 86, ξ 4
(Multitudine telorum ex turribus pmpuynantes deturbant).

mhibebant, as the context shows, means ‘tried to prevent ⁹.

{7- aqqere may hcre be translated by ‘lumber’z it does not
mean ‘an aqqer’, or terrase. Probably the work of piling the
lumber was performed by men who advanced between the
{illlezundeggghe protection of their comrades’ upliftcd shields

ξ 8. eos is governed by vetuit, not by prosequi.
