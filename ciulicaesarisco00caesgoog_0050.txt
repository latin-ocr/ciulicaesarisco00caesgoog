save their rude handiwork, that they would rise superior
to the beasts which the primitive savage regards with
mingled fear and veneration. Yet they buried their dead
with scrupulous care, sometimes placing tools beside them ;
and we may perhaps infer that they fancied that the soul
would still endure. These ancient hunters were not all
of one type. Men with low brutish foreheads and huge
beetling brows ranged over the whole country between
Oroatia and the river Dordogne; gigantic skeletons have
been found in the department of the Dordogne and in the
caves of Mentone3 and before the end of the Quaternary
Period there were living in the caves of LaugerieBasse
and Chancelade a people who, if we may judge from their
well-formed and capacious skulls, possessed an intellectual
capacity not inferior to that of their modern descendants.
They have indeed left evidence of their powers3 for late
in the Palaeolithic Age appeared the dawn of pictoria]
art. From the caves of the Tam-et-Garonne and the
Dordogne have been recovered bones and antlers, en·
graved or carved with likenesses of mammot-hs, reindeer,
and other animab, of fisheS‚ and of men. Specimens of
their work, which are recognized by modern artists as
true works of art, are preserved in the museums of
France ; and reproductions have been published of frescoes
with which, by the dim light of their rude lamps‚ they
covered the walls of Pyrenean caves, The palaeolithic
races had one feature in common: their heads were long
in proportion to their breadth ; and the same characteristic
is found in the skulls of the slender stunted people of
l’Homme Mort and BaumesChaudes in the department
of the Lozere, who, though they were descended from the
older inhabitante, belonged to the Neolithic Age. These
peoples, who are called after the caverns in which the
first specimens were found, appear to have been diffused
over the length and breadth of Gaul. But as the new
epoch advanced, new races began to appear3 and the
invaders, who came from the east, and gradually mingled
with the aborigines, were a short but sturdy folk, charac-
terized by great breadth of skull. The palaeolithic
hunters had been forced to wander in search of gamo ε
