460 CORRIGEN DA AN D ADDEN DA

*19, 5 4. The note on simia (p. 23) is perhaps hardly clear. 1 meant
that simia is not here equivalent to aulem ternpore, but that
simul . . . et is equivalent to et . . . et. Meusel may be right
in supposing that Caesar had already said things which it
was unnecessary to particularize (cum eo conloquitur), and there·
fore that simul is equivalent to praetorem but 1 believe that
simul . . . iubeat (55 4-5) gives the gist of all that· he said.

*30‚ 5 2. Meusel now admits that Caesar may have written term Galliae,
for simssar phrases are frequent in Livy.

31, 5 15. sumac does not mean the same as sumpturus sit. 'l'he present
tense shows that the punishment which Ariovistus was

ἒιὲρεξοῗὲᾱ to inflict was imminent.. See the note onii,

*35‚ 5 4. Meusel now admits doubtfully that (si) id (ita fecisset) may be
genuine, sor id im occurs in Cicero (Am, ii, 24, 5 ὃς v, ὃ,
Mgugglffiiggests that qnod may here be equivalent to quoad, in

which sense the word is used by Varro.

45, 51. pau· ue. Patior never takes a subjunctive except in negatis-e
sentences, and rarely in them.

ii, 16, 5 1. triduum. The reading of B—triduo—may be right; for when
Caesar uses an accusative of time, the verb generally connotcs
Ξιιιίἑιιξτέυρῑεᾶ duration: but there is an exception in

*33, 5 2. viminibus inl-extis. On reconsideration Ι conclude that {matis
agrees with scutis and that riminibus is instrumental.

²⁸35, 5 1. incolerent. Mense-1 now adopts Schneider's explanation oi this
subjunctive‚-‘ even such tribes as dwelt ⁹. He explains
similarly the subjunctives in ii, 27, 55 1, 4.

iii, 9, 5 7. castissimo atque apmissimo is open to suspicion; sor the MSS.
differ greatly. In β vastissimo atque is omitted: τωίίεεὲηιο is
inserted in π before mari ; and χ omits atque apertissimo.

¹⁸¹ 10, 5 2. equitum Romanorum. Military tribunes, as such, had equestrian rank

11, 5 5. Gallicisque naribus . . . iusserat. M. Jullian (Η. G., iii.' 292) thinks
that the ships which Caesar borrowed from the Pictones and
Santoni were used sor transport [of grain 2²] ; but is· it not
possible that he may have thought it advisable to include
in his fleet some ships of native build 2>

13, 55 7 9. These sentences were condemned as an interpolation by
w. Α. Hecker, who is now followed by Meusel. The weighti·
est reasons are that the passage contains statements which
have been already made in the same chapter and others
which are repeated in the next; that 5 9 is obscure and
illogical, sor the words et in radis consisterent tutius et ab cestu
relictae mhil saxa et cotes timerent! have no real connexion with
the preceding words, cum saevire ventus coepisset et ae teneo ‹ledis-
sent, which describe what took place in the open sea3 and
finally that, as commonly happens in interpolated pasmgffi,
the readings of α and β differ widely. Every caresul reader
will have noticed these things; and the passage is at least
suspicions,

*16‚ 5 1. ana-iun· causa. Perhaps the Gaul whom Sabinus employed was
a feet-soldier, for Crassus raised auxiliary infantry in Gaul
before he invaded Aquitania (20, 5 2); but this is the only
passage in which Caesar mentions Gallie auxiliary infantry.

*23‚ 5 7. lt has been suggested as an alternative explanation that quod
may be merely a connecting particle like Quod si (i, 14, 5 3]-

...α-ι- ——r ...--—.-.-‘.
