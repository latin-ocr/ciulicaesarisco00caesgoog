xxxiv THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL

Britain as well as Gaul. As we have seen, the latest
pre-Roman invaders were Oelts. Towards the close οἱ
the Palaeolithic Age the earlier inhabitants were perhaps
joined by immigrants akin to the people of Chancelade
and Lau gerie·Basse; at all events in Derbyshire there
has been found a bone engraved with the figure of
a horse's head, which reminds one of the spirited designs
of the artists of the Dordogne. The neolithic inhabitants
of Britain, so far as we know, belonged for the most part
to the same stock as the long-headed neolithic people of
Gau13 but towards the end of the Neolithic Age immi-
grants‚ of whom I have already spoken, like the round·
heads of the Grenelle type, began to appear, some probably
coming from Gaul, others, as we may infer from the
pottery which they brought with them, from the Nether-
lands and the valley of the Rhine. During the earlier
part of the Bronze Age invaders of a very different kind
came in successive hordes. They too were broad-headed,
but in a less degree 3 they had rugged features and over-
hanging brows; and they were taller and more powerfully
built than the older population. Probably they came
from Denmark or Danish islands‚ where skeletons like
theirs have been unearthed3 and possibly also from the
Scandinavian peninsula. 'I'he first Brythonic settlers
apparently inaugurated the Iron Age in this country,
and they were succeeded by the Belgae, who began to
appear in the third century before Christ.

Enough has been said to enable the general reader
to understand Caesar’s narrative; but any one who may
wish to study the subject more closely will find abundant
information in Gaesar’a Gonqmt of Gaul, pages 257-340,
and Ancient Britain, pages 375-461. See also in regard to

the people of the Neolithic Age in France L'Anthropoloyie,
1912, pages 53-91.
