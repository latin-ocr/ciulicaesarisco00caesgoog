time any leyatus who commanded a legion in Gaul was specially
appointed to his command by Caesar and held it only so long
as Caesar pleased. The office of leyatus was passin through a
transitional stage and ually tending to crysta ‘ze into the
form which it assume under the Empire, when the leyatus
became a leqatus leqione‘s (0. G„ p. 563-4).

Italiam here, as often, means isalpine Gaul ; for Caesar could
not levy troops outside his rovince. -

duasque . . . conscribit. Caesar raised these legions, which
were numbered XI and XII, on his own responsibility. This is
proved by the facts that it was agreed in the conference which

e held with Pompey and Crassus at Luca in 56 ac. that he
should receive a grant for the payment of the legions which he
had raised (Cicer0‚ De prov. cona, 11, ξ 28; Suetonius, Divus
Iulius, 24; Plutarch, Camr, 21), and that this grant was voted
by the Senate (Cicero, Fam„ i, 7,§ 10). We may suppose that
before Caesar left Italy the recrmts had received orders to be
ready to assemble along the read, so as to join the veteran
legions on their march from Aquileia; for otherwise he might
not have been able to reach the Saone near Lyons by the early
part of June, as he certain] did (12, ἕξ 1-2; 16, ξ 2). See
C. G„ p. 48, n. 2, and C. Q„ 1 12, p. 80.

close to Avigliana (see . 418 : therefore in the Italian part of
his march Caesar moved) up t e valley of the Dora Ripana, and
of course crossed the Mont Genevre and passed by Brigantio
(Briancon) in the country of the Caturiges. As he was making
for that part of the country of the Segusiavi which lies between
the Rhene and the Saone near Lyons (see the note on 11, § 1),
it will be evident to any one who consults a ood map that his
shortest route would have led past Grenoble, if etween Briancon
and Grenoble there was then a practicable road ε but it is very
doubtful whether this route would have led him into the country
of the Vocontii ; and Ι therefore believe that he took the
roadsslvvssilbll leads past Embrun, Chorges, Gap, and Die (C. G„
