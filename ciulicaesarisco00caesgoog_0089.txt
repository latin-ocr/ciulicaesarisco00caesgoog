COMMENTARIUS I 17

oblivisci vellet, num etiam recentium iniuriarum, quod
eo invito iter per provinciam per vim temptassent,
quod Haeduos, quod Ambarros, quod Allobrogas
vexassent, memoriam deponere posse? Quod sua 4
5 victoria tam insolenter gloriarentur quodque tam
diu se impune iniurias tulisse admirarentur, eodem
pertinere. Consuesse enim deos immortales, quo 5
gravius homines ex commutatione rerum doleant,
quos pro scelere eorum ulcisci velint, his secundiores

quod (eo invito), as in 12, 3 7, and many other passages, serves
to explain a preceding wor ,-—here iniuriarum. A translation
will make this clear: ⁸ Even if he were willing to forget an old
affront, how could he banish the recollection of fresh outrages,

Where quod means ‘because ', asin 6, ξ 3, 9, ξ 3, and 47, §2,
the meaning is unmistakable.

If posse is the ‘ ht reading. not posset, which is found in χ,
its subject can 355 be se understood. Meusel (J. Β., 1894,
p. 339) thinks that it may be populum Romanum. This seems
to me impossible; sor the Roman People could not have been
said to forget outrages which had only just been committed
and of which they therefore knew nothing. Meusel, re-
marking that in ξ 2 the subJect is populus Romanae, insists
that if the subject of vellet (δ 3) is Caesar, seis required before
posse, and says that it may have been omitted in the MSS. by
a {ogmagdneggzffihe note on 13, § 5.

se . . . tulisse. Schneider argues that, although Sallust (Ju-
qurtha, 31, ξ 2) uses impune actively, se cannot refer to Caesar,
for Caesar had not long (diu) put up with the outrages of the Hel·
vetii. Referring to Cicero, Fam„ xiii, 77, ξ 3 (servus meus . . . cum
multos libros surripuisset nec se impune laturum putaret, aufu-
9⁸⁸²), he says that impune iniurias tulisse means ‘ had committed
injuries withimpunity ’ς and similarly Kraner explains impune
aliquid serre as meaning ‘ o escape unishment for something ’.
Mommsen, however (J. Β., 1894, p. 280), deleted iniurias (impune
tulisse would then mean ‘had got off scot-free’). remarkmg

refxained from attacking them '. St111, the Helvetn had com-
mitted outrages; and I see no reason to doubt that Caesar
made the remark in question. Prammer's emendation—(iniurias)
intulisse—seems to me uncalled for.

eodem pertinere may be translated by ‘pointed to the same
conclusion ’.
