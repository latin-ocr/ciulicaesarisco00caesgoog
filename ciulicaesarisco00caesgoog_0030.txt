xxiv THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL

the Rhene, with Iberians. So much we learn from
historians and geographers: but there is some reason
to believe that Ligurians occupied the whole eastern
region of Gaul as far north as the Marne; for certain
suffixes, or endings of place-names, namely -asca, -asco,
·osca‚ -osco, meaa and -u300, which are found very frequently
in Piedmont, where Ligurians were the primitive in-
habitante, also occur in twenty-five of the eastern depart-
ments ¹ of France, and these departments form one
unbroken tract. Indeed it is not improbable that
Ligariana, even in Caesar’s time, inhabited Aquitania3
for there were five tribes in Liguria proper³ and sixteen
or seventeen in Aquitania⁸ whose names ended in -atcs3
and such names are to be found nowhere else in Gaul.⁴
The Iberians probably migrated into Seuthem Gaul from
Spain ; for Iberians occupied the whole eastern region of
the Spanish peninsula, though the name ‘Iberian’ was
perhaps applied originally only to a people who dwelt
between the river Ebro and the Pyrenees. It is generally
believed, though some scholars are of a different opinion,
that Basque, which is still spoken in the south-western
corner of France and the adjacent part of Spain, is closely
related to the language, of which there were doubtless
several dialectS, that was spoken by the Iberians. Several
place-names are quoted to prove this, especially Iliberri-s,
which occurs, in various forms, both in Spain and in
Southern Gaul. There was an Illiberris in Roussillon, an
Elimberri in Auch, and an Illiberri in Granada. The
word iri in Basque means ‘ town ⁹ and berri means ‘ new ’ 3
so that Iliberri& like the Celtic Noviodunum,⁸ would have
meant ‘ New Town '. This word, however, has given riae

and ten or eleven others mentioned by Pliny (N.H., iv, 19, 5 108).

⁴ The Belgic Atrebates are perhaps only an apparent exception.
It must, however, be admitted that no Aquitanian names in -asca‚

δια, have been cited.
