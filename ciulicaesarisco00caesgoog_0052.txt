the neck, and fancifully decorated with geometrical
figures, were brought from Ireland; comparison of the
types of pottery‚ of knives and axes, razors and swords‚
of bracelets, pins, and brocches, shows that many were
derived from Italy and Germany; and before the end of
the Hallstatt period trade was established with the Greeks,
while wine was imported and distributed by the merchants
of Massilia.

The earliest inhabitants of Gaul about whom history
has anything to tell were the Ligurians and IberianS,
neither of whom are mentioned by Caesar. According
to the ancient geographer-S, the land which originally
belonged to the Ligurians was the mountainous tract
between the Rhene, the Durance, and the Cottian and
Maritime Alps: but by the fifth century before Christ
they were mingled with Iberians on the west of the
Rhone; and from the evidence of certain geographical
names as well as of archaeology‚ it would seem that they
once possessed the whole of Eastern Gaul as far north as
the Mame. The culture of this region in the Bronze Age
differed from that of the west, but closely resembled that
of N orthern Italy, where we know that Ligurians lived.
The vast number of sickles which have been discovered
in the south-east show that the Ligurians were industrious
tillers of the soil; and they may have been descended‚ at
least in part, from Swiss lake-dwellers of the Stone Age,
who probably introduced cereals and domestic animals
into GauL The origin of the Iberians remains uncertain:
but when they came under the notice of the Greeks they
occupied the eastern part of Spain as well as the country
between the Pyrenees and the Rhone3 and it should
seem that they had crossed the Pyrenees and made
conquests in Aquitania as well as on the Mediterranean
coast. There can be little doubt that in the land which
belonged to them, in Spain as well as in Southern Gaul,
there once existed, besides Celtic, at least two forms of

speech, -Basque and a language or languages, still unde· '

inscriptions. But if the Iberians were not one race, the

bulk of them were small and dark, and not unlike the
