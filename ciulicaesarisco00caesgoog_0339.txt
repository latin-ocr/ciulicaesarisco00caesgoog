In ii, 30, ᾗ 4 omnibust, not hominibgainallisQ is certainly the
right readm . Omnes is not inconsistent with ayri culturae non
student (22, 1), which, as we may infer from iv, 1, §§ 6-8, means
no more than (the Germans) ‘ are not an agricultural people ⁹.

ξ 3. cohortium XII. Kraner thinks that these cohorte were com·
posed of auxiliaries—archers and elingere (see p. litim—because,
as 33, ξς 1-3, compared with 32, ξ 6, prove, all the ten legions
(see the note on 1, ξ 4) remained in the field. 1 doubt whether
he is right, for Caesar would surely have called auxiliary
cohorte auxiliares, as in B. 0., i, 63, ξ 1, or alariae (cf. i, 51, ξ 1 ;
B. G.. i, 73 ξ 3; 83,§ 13 ii, 18, 1); and the mere fact that he
mentions the presence in the eld of the ten legions does not
prove that cohorte had not been detached from them. Com-
pare v, 8‚§ 2 with 9, ξ 1 and 11, {hl Ι suppose that these
cohorts were withdrawn from the me when the army went
into winter-quartem. They were certainly required in the
seventh campaign. ·

adulescentem. See the note on i, 52, ξ 7.

§4. profectus . . . patet. These words were bracketed by Meusel
(J. Β., 1910, p. 31-2) ; but he now eandidly admits (ib., 1911,
p. 112) that {lotz (C.S., p. 101), who puts a comma after pro-
fectus, is probably right in retaining profectus . . . silvam and
taking per Arduennam silvam with L. Minucium . . . praemittit.
The rest of the is condemned b Klotz ( . 53) as well
as by Meusel. fleusel finds it incredib e that aesar should
have so grossly exaggerated the extent of the forest; and Klotz
(p. 101) argues that Strabo (iv, 3, § 5), who censures the exag-
geration, was not referring to Caesar, but to Timagenes, from
whom, in Klotz's opinion, the alleged interpolation was derived.
