enough to enable them to do this. M. Jullian understands the
Latin in the sense that the Helvetii had left the Boi and
Tulin i on the road to guard the ons, in front of which
they ad been marchi . I believe t at he is right; but if
sc, the wagons must sure y have been protected in their rear by
another force, which took no part in the battle (0. G. , p. 629-30).

(ab) latere a erto. 'Phe insertion of ab, as Meusel shows
(J. Β., 1894, p. 99, with which cf. L. 0., i, 36—9), is necessary.
The words mean ‘ on the right flank ⁹, which was exposed
(aperto) because the shield was worn on the left arm. This was
denied by Stoffel‚ who maintained that the words simply meant
‘on the exposed flank',—left or right, as the case m ht be;
but there are at least three passages in Caesar—iv, ²2⁸6, ξ 3;
v, 35, ξ 2 ; and vii, 82, ξ 2—-which prove that ab latere aperto is
a technical military phrase, and means what 1 have said. For
the troops which are mentioned in each of these passages were
exposed, as far as their position was concerned, on their left as
well as on their right; and therefore either ab latere apa-to
signified ‘on the right and unshielded flank’ or it signified
nothing. 'Phe passage on which this note is written is fully
discussed in C. G„ pp. 621-3, the arguments in which have been
accepted on the Continent as conclusive.

ξ 7. Mommsen (J. Β., 1894, p. 201) gives a sufficient reason
for regarding conversa as an interpolation :—‘ the first two lines

puqnatum sit. If Caesar had written pugnaretur, he would, so
to speak, have been lacing the reader at the standpoint of a
s ectator of the batt e; whereas the perfect merely states that
t e battle lasted seven hours without calling upon the reader to
form a mental picture of it. See J. Β., 1894, p. 357.
