250 DE BELLO GALLIGO

21 Germani multum ab hac consuetudine differunt.
Nam neque druides habent, qui reb'us divinis praesint,

Reman 2 neque sacrificiis student. Deorum numero eos solos ³

‘ through the medium of a public assembly.’ But the preposi-
tion may be translated by ‘in ⁹, which sug ests the meaning. Ι

21, δ 2. Deorum numero . . . Lunam. he Germane were in
an earlier stage of religione thought than the Gauls, and still
worshipped the forces of Nature, which the Gauls, perhaps
under the influence of the Greeks of Massilia, had personified.
A hundred years later the Germans too had gods whom the
Romans equated with Mars and Minerva (Tacitus, Germania, 9).

ξ 4. hoc . , . hoc. 'I'he reading of a is hoc alii maturum, alii,
which is obviously wrong; and that of B—alii hoe acturam,
alii hoc—is no better. An emendation is therefore necessary ;
and, at first sight, that of vascosanus—hoc ali staturam, ali,
which only differs by the omission of a letter from the read’
of a—seems quite satisfactory. But a Danish scholar, Pro .
M. cl. Gertz, conjectures that Caesar wrote hoc staturam ali,
hoc, which brings the order of the words into harmony with the
following clause. ⁴

§5. Intra annum . . . nuda. If the reader will ponder this
passage, he will see that Intra . . . vicesimum can only refer to
feminae3 in other words, it must mean ‘before hcr twentieth
year ⁹. With influminibus . . . nuda cf. iv, 1, ᾗ 10.

renonum. According to Isidore, a Spanish lexicographer of the
seventh century (Etymol., xix, 23, §4)‚ mones werehairy ments,
intended to cover the shoulders and breast; and Sal ust (Hist.
fraym„ iii, 57, ii, 58 vol. ii, . 126 of R. Dietsch's ed.]) says that
they were made of s ins. T e word reno also means a mindeer.
