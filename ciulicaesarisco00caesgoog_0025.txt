CAESAR'S NARRATIVE xix

'campaigns followed as a matter of course. And his self-
justification was sound. Naturally he made out the best
case that he could, but he did not falsify facts: he only
emphasized‚ as he had a right to de, the fact that he had
acted for his country’s good. So far as 1 am swero,
no great writer, no great historian‚ no great statesman
or general has ever thrown serious, discredit upon the
Commentaries. Of course they are not absolutely true:
no history is. Caesar was sometimes either uncriticsl or
csreless in using the reports of his generals: he may have
thought it discreet to withhold some valuable information
he doubtless sometimes exaggerated‚ probably because h
was misinformed‚ the numbers of his enemies and the
losses which he or his officers had inflicted upon them;
he may have concocted an excuse for the one defeat—the
defeat st Gergovia—which he himself suffered ; and 1 am
willing to believe that his memoirs leave upon the mind
an impression of his prowesS‚ if not of his character, more
favourable than would have been produced by the narra-
tive of an impartial historien. But on the whole he
could afford to tell the truth. He did full justice to his
lieutenants3 he wrote most genereusly of his enemies ;ι
and I see no reason for believing that he was ashamed
of anything that he had done. ‘On ne peut contester ’‚
says the Duc d’Aumale, ‘ que ses recits respirent la
sincerite' ς’* and Montaigne‚ in a note written on the
margin of his copy of the Commentarie3‚ called the author
⁴ le plus net, le plus disert, et le plus sincere historien qui
fut jamais ’.³ Perhaps we shall hit the exact truth if we
add the comment of the Duc d’Aumale‚—‘ le plus sincere
de ceux qui ont ecrit leur propre histoire! ⁴
