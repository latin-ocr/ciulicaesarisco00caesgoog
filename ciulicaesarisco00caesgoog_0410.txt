Accordingly several editors have bracketed aut adductos i ”
ex provincia expellere as an interpolation. 1 am not sure t
this is necessary. The following sentence—Quam ad spem . . .
videntur—proves that the Aedui wished to prevent Caesar from
reaching 1116 Province and to starve him out between the Loire
and the Allien but doubtless they hoped‚ if they could not
prevent him from 16861181ἷὼ6 Province, to force 11118 to 36 by

a later editor, who saw that (Nam) ut (commutato, 818),
