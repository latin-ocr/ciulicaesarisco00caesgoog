COMMENTARIUS II 71

manus hostium distineri, ne cum tanta multitudine
uno tempore confligendum sit. Id fieri posse, si suas 3
copias Haedui in fines Bellovacorum introduxerint et
eorum agros populari coeperint. His (datis) mandatis 4
6 eum a se dimittit. Postquam omnes Belgarum copias
in unum locum coactas ad se venire vidit neque iam
longe abesse ab iis quos miserat exploratoribus et ab
Remis cognovit, flumen Axonam, quod est in extremis
Remorum finibus, exercitum traducere maturavit atque
10 ibi castra posuit. Quae res et latus unum castrorum 5
ripis fluminis muniebat et post eum quae erant tuta
ab hostibus reddebat et commeatus ab Remis reli·

§4. in unum locum coactas. Where did the Belgae concen-
trate ⁰? It is not certain whether they marched against Caesar
up the valley of the Aisne-the Axona which Caesar mentions
in this sentence—or towards the Aisne from north to south.
M. Jullian decides for the former, because it was the natural
route for the Bellovaci and the Suessiones, who furnished the
strongest contingente to the confederate army. But if they
had taken this route, it is unlikely that they would have
marched on the north of the Aisne, as the narrative (5-7) roves
that they did, to attack Caesar, who was still on the sont ε for
if they had marched on the south, they would have compelled
him either to fall back or to march westward against them, for
sear his communications should be cut; and M, Jullian himself
admits that if they had concentrated on the Aisne, their natu-
ral line of march would have been the road from Soissons to
Reims. Resides, it is impossible to find a satisfactory site for
Bibrax, the stronghold which they attacked when they were
marchin against Caesar (6, ξ 1), at any point on or near the
road leading from Soissons to the place where he crossed the
Aisnez indeed, unless that place was Rern-au-Bac-and this,
as 1 shall show in the note on 8,§§ 3—5, is very doubtful-Bi-
brax was certainly not in the valley of the Aisne (ἒθο p. 411).
It is probable, therefore, that the point where the elgae eon·
centrated was notin the valley‚ but somewhere north of the
Aisne —perhaps near La Fere on the Oise—and at a consider-
able distance from it (C. G„ pp. 658—9).

vidit is deleted by Meusel (J. B„ 1910, p. 67) on the ground
that, couplet] with coynom't, it can only mean ‘ saw with his own
eyes ⁹. . Schneider, on the other hand. maintains that it means
⁸ realized’ and that, if it were omitted, there would be nothing
to show that Caesar acted from careful consideration and from
conviction as well as from mere information. I cannot under·
stand what motive an interpolator could have had for inserting
vidit.

ibi castra meust. The question of the site of this camp is dis·
cussed in the note on 8, ξῇ 3-5.
