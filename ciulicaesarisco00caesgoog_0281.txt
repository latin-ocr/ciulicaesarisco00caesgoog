COMMENTARIUS V 199

iam hunc annum regnantem inimici palam multis
ex civitate auctoribus interfecerunt. Defertur ea res

ad Caesarem. Ille verituS, quod ad plures pertinebat, 4

ne civitas eorum impulsu deficeret, L. Plancum cum
5 legione ex Belgio celeriter in Carnutes proficisci iubet
ibique hiemare, quorumque opera cognoverit Tasgetium

interfectum, hoe comprehensos ad se mittere. Interim 5

ab omnibus legatis quaestoribusque, quibus legiones
tradiderat, certior factus est in hiberna perventum
10 locumque [hibernis] esse munitum.

Klotz (0.S., pp. 254-5) remarks that it diffens so much from
that of β that we evidently have to do with something more than

to know what palam belongs to. Accordingly h’e attempts to
fill up the obvious gaps in α as followsz—inimiois [iam] multis

emendation is ingenious, and the reading of β ma not be right ;
but if the reader will turn to 54, § 2, he will hardyl believe that
the Carnutes first banished Tasgetius and then kil ed him.

ξ 5. hibernis. 1 have little doubt that eusel (J.B., 1910, p. 61)
is right in deleting this word. Doberenz-Dinter, who admit
that it is very surprising‚ take it as a dative—(‘the place) for
the winter quartem ’— and compare it with i, 30, 3.

means ‘ frontier ’.

Indutiomarus had been obli ed a few months before to give
Caesar 200 hostages, among w om were all his own kinsmen
(4, §§ 1-2); but we may infer from vi, 2,§ 1 (Interfecto ln-
dutiomaro . . . ad eiuspropae'nquos a Treveris imperium defertur)
that Caesar, after he returned from Britain, had thought it best
to restore them. When one reads v, 22, ξ 4 one finds it hard to
conceive why he did so. ·
