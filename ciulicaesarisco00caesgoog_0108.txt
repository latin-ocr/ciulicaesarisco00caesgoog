Anyhow, good jud es are now almost all agreed thssffhresse is
no reason for disbe ievin Caesar when he says that, accordin
to the Helvetian schedu e, the original strength of the allie
army was 92,000 (0. G„ pp. 237-41). See, however, p. 436.
fuerunt. Both the number and the tense are noticeable. In

declared sese paratos esse imperatoris sui tribunorumque plebis
