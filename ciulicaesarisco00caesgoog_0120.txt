46 DE BELLO GALLICo

ut satis commode supportari posset, timere dicebant.

7 Ν on nulli etiam Caesari nuntiabant, cum castra mo-
veri ac signa ferri iussisset, non fore dicto audientes
milites neque propter timorem signa laturos.

niumque ordinum ad id consilium adhibitis centurio-

quam in partem aut quo consilio ducerentur sibi

57. siqua sert-i simply means ‘to advance’. The standards
glayed so important a part as mllyingpoints for the men that

aesar constantly uses the word siqua in phrases in which it
cannot be translated literally.

40, §L omniu ue ordinum. .centurionibus. Councils of
war were not ‘atten ed by centurione exce t those of‘ the first
rank’ ,—the six centurions of the first co ort of each legion.
All the centurione were summoned to this couucil, which was
not a eouncil of war, because all were, more or less, concerned.

adhibitis centurionibus, vehementer eos incusavit. This con-
struction frequently recurs iu Caesar, often apparently, as here,
for the sake of emphasis, sometimes perhaps as a mere man-
nerism. Adhibitos centur-’iones incusavit would be much less
forcible than the expression which Caesar used.

putarent. The learner should not pass on to the next sentence
until he is sure that he under-stands why Caesar wrote putarent,
not arabant. When he really understands he will never be

puzzfed again. If Caesar had used the indicative, the meaning
would have been, ‘Caesar accused them because they thought';
in other words, ‘Gaesar's motive for accusing them was that
they thought,’ &.c But this is not exactly what he meant.
His meaning was, ‘Caesar accused them, and gave as his reason
for accusing them the fact that they thoughtss&c.'1'o bring
out the meaning of such subjunctives in idiomatic English
requires hard thinking. This translation, Ι think, will serve: -

‘Observing the state of affairs, Caesar called a meeting, to
which the centurions of all grades were summoned, and rated
them severely for presuming to suppose, ’.&c

ξ 2. iudicaret. According to one of the rules formulated by

and ιιι Oratio Recta iudicaret would become iudicat. But I have
noticed that Caesar often violates socalled rules of Oratio
Obliqua, and since he was certainly a master of his own
language, one may be allowed to suggest that the rules need
revtilsion.1 find that Meusel (J. Β., 1894, pp. 388-9) agrees
wi me.
