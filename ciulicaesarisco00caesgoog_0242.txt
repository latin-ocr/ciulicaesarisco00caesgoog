160 DE BELLO GALLICO ι

6 admitteretur, universi ex navi desiluerunt. Hos item
ex proximis primi navibus cum conspexissent, subse- 1
cuti hostibus adpropinquaverunt.

26 Pugnatum est ab utrisque acriter. Nostri tamen,

quod neque ordines servare neque firmiter insistere 5
neque signa subsequi poterant atque alius alia ex navi
quibuscumque signis occurrerat se adgregabat, ma-
2 gnopere perturbabantur; hostes ver0, notis omnibus
vadis, ubi ex litore aliquos singulares ex navi egre-
dientes conspexerant, incitatis equis impeditos adorie- 10
3 bantur, plures paucos circumsistebant, alii ab latere
4 aperto in universos tela coiciebant. Quod cum anim·
advertisset Caesar, scaphas longarum navium, item
speculatoria navigia militibus compleri iussit, et quos
laborantes conspexerat, his subsidia submittebat. 15
5 Nostri, simul in arido constiterunt, suis omnibus
consecutis, in hostes impetum fecerunt atque eos in
fugam dederunt3 neque longius prosequi potuerunt,
quod equites cursum tenere atque insulam capere non
potuerant. Hoc unum ad pristinam fortunam Cae· 20

ξ 6. primi is a conjecture of Madvi s; and Meusel (J. B.. 1910,
p. 61), who adopts ιι, brackets na ,—in my opinion unne-
cessarily. The MS. reading—(proximis) primis ”ambus —al·
though ySchneider defends it, is nonsense; for it would imply
that the ships were ranged ιιι at least two lines, one behind
the other; and since the soldiers could only just leap into
the sea without being drowned, those who were on board the
ships in the ἰιιιιιὲἰιιειιςγ narysecond line could not have done so, for
theu· shi s woul have been ιιι deeper water.

26. ξ. universos does not mean all the Roman soldier-⁸3 for
the line of ships from which they were landin must have been
fully a mile long. The word is contrasted wit simulares (ξ 2)
and means ‘an entire group’.
