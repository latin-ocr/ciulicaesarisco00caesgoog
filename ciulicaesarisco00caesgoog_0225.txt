COMMENTARIUS IIII 145

tutum esse arbitrabatur neque suae neque populi
Romani dignitatis esse statuebat. Itaque, etsi summa 2
difficultas faciendi pontis proponebatur propter
latitudinem, rapiditatem altitudinemque fluminis,
5 tamen id sibi contendendum aut aliter non traducen-
dum exercitum existimabat. Rationem pontis hanc 3
instituit. Tigna bina sesquipedalia paulum ab imo
praeacuta dimensa ad altitudinem fluminis intervallo
pedum duorum inte'r sejungebat. Haec cum machina· 4
10 tionibus immissa in fiumen defixerat fistucisque
adegerat, non sublicae modo derecte ad perpendiculum,
sed prone ac fastigate‚ ut secundum naturam fluminis
procumberent, iis item contraria duo ad eundem 5
modum iuncta intervallo pedum quadragenum ab
15 inferiore parte contra vim atque impetum fluminis
conversa statuebat. -Haec utraque insuper bipedali bus 6
trabibus immissis, quantum eorum tignorum iunctura
distabat, binis utrimque fibulis ab extrema parte

the note on 15, ξ 2, Ι am inclined to prefer the neighbourhood
of Coblenz because Caesar’s chief object in invading Germany
in 53 Β. ο. was to prevent the Germans from reinsorcing the
Treveri, whose territory, as we have seen, probably did not
extend so far northward as Bonn, and whose political contre,
TreveS, was south even of Coblenz. I therefore conclude,
though doubtfully, that both the first and the second brid e
were built between Coblenz and Andernach (C. G„ p: 706-13).

§4. mohinationibaae, like ‘tackle ’, is a vagus tec mcal term,
and apparently denotes both the barges or rafts which were of
course necessary and the apparatus by means of which the balks
(tiyna) were lowered. Nowadays a kind of tripod would be used,
formed of three masts and furnished at the top with a pulley.

fastiqate here means ‘ sloping like the gable of a roof‘ (sasti-
9ium). lI translate prone ac sastiyate by ‘ leaning forward in the
same ane ’.

ξ 5.Ppedum quadragenum. Forty feet could· not have been the
distance along the bed of the river (unless Caesar meant
the greatest distance) on account of the difference between the
depth near the bank and in mid-stream, which would have
caused a variation either in the width of the roadway or in the
angle formed by the balks ; for he says that the balks were made
of va ing lengths to suit the va ing depth of the stream.
'rherofcre (unless he was thinkin ο the greatest distance along
the bed) the measurement must ave been made either between
the tops of the balks or, more probabl , along the surface of the
water. For the roadway‚ 40 feet wou d have been an excessive

width.
