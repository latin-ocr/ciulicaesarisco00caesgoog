exercised subordinate commands. But the principal officers
were the lcyati, who might loosely be called generals of
division. Their powers were not strictly defined, but
varied according to circumstances and to the confidence
which they deserved. A legatus might be entrusted with
the command of a legion or of an army corps3 he might
even, in the absence of his chief, be entrusted with the
command of the entire army. But he was not yet, as
such, the permanent commander of a legion. The officers
upon whom the efficiency of the troops mainly depended
were the centurions. They were chosen from the ranks;
and their position has been roughly compared with that
of our own non-commissioned officers. But their duties
were, in some respects, at least as responsible as those of
a captain: the centurions of the first cohort were regu-
larly summoned to councils of war; and the chief centurion
of a legion was actually in a position to offer respectful
suggestions to the legate himself. Every legion included
in its ranks a number of skilled artisans, called fabri, who
have been likened to the engineers in a modern army3
but they were not permanently enrolled in a separate
corps, They fought in the ranks like other soldiers; but
when their special services were required, they were
directed by staff-officers called praefecti fabrum. It was
their duty to execute repairs of every kind, to superintend
the construction of permanent camps, and to plan fortifi-
cations and bridges; and it should seem that they also
had charge of the artillery‚-the ballistae and catapults,
which hurled heavy stones and shot arrows against the
defences and the defendere of a besieged town.

The legionary wore a sleeveless woollen shirt, a leathern
tunic protected across breast and back by bands of metal‚
strips of cloth wound round the thighs and legs, hob·
nailed shoes, and, in cold or wet weather, a kind of
blanket or military cloak. His defensive armour con·
sisted of helmet, shield, and greaves: his weapons were
a short, two-edged, cut-and·thrust sword and a javelin‚
the blade of which, behind the hardened point, w'as made
of soft iron, so that, when it struck home, it might bend
and not be available for return. These, however, formed
