the towers which stood upon the ayyer (666 1116 second note

on 12, §5) doubtless did their best to keep them at a distance.
Sappe'm‘ huts of extraordinary stre 11, the slo ing roofs of
which were protectcd against 1116 y 111-10116, c‚ay and raw
hides soaked 111 water (see the last 11016 011 ν, 42, 5), would
therefore be placed on 1116 ayyer, near its edge; an ,screened
by them, the men could shoot earth, timber, and fascines into
the vacant space until the mass reached the necessary hei ht.

The width of an aqqer must have depended up on its 0 ject.
At Avaricum the obj 601 was 10 take the town by escalade (vii, 27),
and therefore the ayy yet· was necessarily very broad (24, '§1);
but when, as in the 616 6 of the strong hold of the Α11161601

How the vineae were used in constructing an ayyer 16 6
difficult question. The men who brought up the material for
the original ayyeres at Massilia passed it, like brickla yers, from
hand 10 hand under the protection of vineae (B. 0., 11, 2, ξ 3);
11111 whether vineae were used by the men who actually reared'
the fabric, we are not told. Asy they were still nearer to the
enemy, they must have been protected somehow; but inside
vineae they could not have worked. We must suppose that they
were screened by the defences, called plutei, which Ve 611116
