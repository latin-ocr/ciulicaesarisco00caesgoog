INTRODUCTION xlvii

neolithic people of l'Homme Mort. In Caesar’s time
Liguria, as well as the land of the Iberians, was also
peopled by the descendants of Celtic invaders. It was The Gelts.
about the seventh century before the Christian era that
the tall fair Celts began to cross the Rhine, accompanied
doubtless by the descendants of aliens who had joined
them during their long sojourn in Germany. successive
swarms spread over the land, partly subduing and minglin g
with the descendants of the palaeolithic peoples and of
their neolithic conquerere, partly perhaps driving them
into the mountainous tracts. Physically‚ they resembled
the Germans whom Caesar and Tacitus describe; but
they differed from them in character and customs as well
as in speech. The Belgio Celts were the latest comers;
and if Caesar was rightly informed‚ the languages of the
Belgae and the Celtae were distinct. of the modern
Celtic dialect& Gaelic, which is spoken in the Highlands
of Scotland‚ Manx, and Erse, which is spokenxin the west
of Ireland‚ are descended from an old Celtic language,
called Goideli03 while Welsh and Breton are traceable to
the British language called Brythonic, which was closely
akin to Gaulish or Gallo-Erythonic. The difference
between the languages of the Belgae and the Celtae was
- probably slight3 for if a Goidelic dialect was spoken
anywhere in Gaul, the vestiges of Gallie that remain
belong, for the most part, to the Brythonic branch of the
Celtic tongue- In Aquitania the natives remained com·
paratively pure, and formed a separate group, which, in
Caesar-’s time, stood politically spart from the Celtae as
well as from the Belgae. They are generally spoken
of as an Iberian people3 but the name is misleading.
The conquering Celts, as we may infer from proper nameS,
had advanced, though probably in small numberS, beyond
the Garonne; and evidence supplied by recent measure·
ments of living inhabitants appears to show that in certain
parts of Aquitania the old broad-headed element was con-
siderable. But it is certain that the Celtic language was
not generally spoken in Aquitania3 and the Iberian type
was sufficieutly conspicuous to give some support to the
popular theory.
