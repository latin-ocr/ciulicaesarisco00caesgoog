territory of the Coriosohtes corresponded more or less closely

with the cetea-du-Nord (0. Gn PP· 415-18).

DacL—The Dacians possessed Hungary, eastof the riverTheisS,
Transylvania, Wallachia, Moldavia, west of the Pruth,&c.

Decetia is re resented by the modern Decize, which is on
the Loire, about ⁶ Ο miles south-east of Nevers.

Diablintea.—Caesar does not help us to determine the
territory of this tribe; but Ptolemy (θεωρῇ, ii, 8, ξ 7) says that
their chief town was Noeodunum, which in the Table osPeutinqer
(p. 23, col. 1) appears as Nu·Dionnum, on the road between
Le Mans and Bayeux. Accordingly it is believed that they
occupied the neighbourhood of J ublains, which preserves their
name, and on the site of which the remains of acano-Roman
town have been discovered. Moreover‚ a document of the
eighth cent mentions condita De'ablt’mica (a district or
canton of the iablintes) as situated in mo cenomanico. The
conclusion is that the Diablintes possessed the northern part of
the diocese of Le Mans, the rest of which belonged to the
Aulerci Cenomani (C. G„ pp. 418-22).

Dubis was the Gallie name of the river Doubs.

Eburones—The greater art of their country was between
the Rhine and the Meuse (v, 4, ᾗ 4) ; so we· may infer that the

οη the north the Menapii 33, §§ 1-2) 3 and on the south-west
the Atuatuci (v, 38, ξ 1). heir territory may also have been
conterminous on the west with that of the Nervii. But it is
impossible to define the frontiers of any of these peoplea
except perhaps the Nervii3 and therefore it is impossible to
define the frontier of the Eburones. We only know that it
extended westward of Bonn and Cologne and included rts of
trhe provinces of Limbourg and Liege (0. G„ p. 38 . See
' navam.

Eburovices. See Aetnam Enunovrcns.

Elaver was the Gallie name of the river Allier.

Eleuteti. See Cannam.

Elusates. The name of this people survives in that of
Eauze, the country round which they possessed (C. G„ p. 422).

Esuvii.--The Esuvii were one of the tribes from whom
Crassus requisitioned corn (iii, 7, ξ 4) when he was sent to
receive the submission of the states of Normandy and Brittany.
Their position has been determined with reasonable probability
in this way. Pliny (Nat. Hist„ iv, 18, ξ 107) mentions the
Baiocasses, or, as he calls them, Bodiocasses, whose chief town
was Augustodurus (Bayeux)‚ and the Viducasses, whose chief town
was Aregenua or Araegenue (Vieux, near Caen). The Nomia
provinciarum (p. 263 [ii, 6]) mentions a eople called the Saii,
whose territory corresponded with the 'ocese of sees. Nono
