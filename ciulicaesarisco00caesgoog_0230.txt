Gallae'am—the reading of s—is probably right, although the
rest of the MSS. have Galliam for while Cicero (Fam, viii. 5, ξ 2ς
9, §5 2, 5) uses the plural in referring to the several divisione of
Gaul, Caesar uses the singular more than 100 times and the
plural nowhere else; and there seems to be no reason why he
should have used it here. cf. J.B., 1894, p. 251.

§ 4. Itaque . . . reperire poterat. Many commentators have
insisted that the traders could have told Caesar all that 116
wanted to know, and certainly it seems difficult to under·
stand how they could have professed ignorance of the harbours
without manifest contumacy: but, at least as regards the other
questions, the reasons which he assigns for their silence are
sufficient. Moreover, as they only knew the harbours of Kent
(v, 13, ᾗ 1), none of which could shelter ala e fleet, it is quite
intelligible that even on this point they shoul have been unable
to enlighten him. Still, they could have given valuable informa-
tion about the Kentish coast3 and the passa-ge in which Strabo
(iv, 4, 11) says that 'the Veneti attacked Caesar because they
were etermined to prevent him from invading Britain, the
trade with which was in their hands, sug sts that the merchants
kept silence from interested motivas. hey could not foresee
that Caesar’s expeditione would stimulate British trade.

21,§ 4. quam . . . cont-enim. We may be sure that these ships
were not in any port in the country of the Veneti (the depart-
ment of the Morbihan) or anywhere near it when Caesar sent
for them; for as only ‘a small part of the sqmmer' (20, ξ 1)
remained when he began to prepare for the invasion of Britain,
there would have been no time for his messengers to travel to
the mouth of the Loire or for the galleys to make the voyage of
600 miles from the Loire to the north-eastern coast of Gaul.
When the messengers set out, the galleys must have been near
the port (Boulogne) from which he sailed,—probably in the
mouth of the Scine or of the Somme. We may infer that Cacsar
had contemplated invading Britain long before the close of this
