288 DE BELLO GALLICO

4 cognosceret. Indignantes milites Caesar, quod con-
spectum suum hostes ferre possent tantulo spatio
interiectO, et signum proelii exposcentes edocet quanto
detrimento et quot virorum fortium morte neeesse

5 sit constare victoriam3 quos cum sic animo paratos 5
videat ut nullum pro sua la'ude periculum recusent,
summae se iniquitatis condemnari debere, nisi eorum

6 vitam salute sua habeat cariorem. Sic milites con·
solatus eodem die reducit in castra reliquaque quae
ad oppugnationem oppidi pertinebant administrare ιο
instituit.

20 Vercingetorix, cum ad suos redisset, proditionis in-
simulatus, quod castra propius Romanos movisset,
quod cum omni equitatu discessisset, quod sine imperio
tantas copias reliquisset, quod eius discessu Romani 1⁵

omnia fortuito aut sine consilio accidere potuisse3
regnum illum Galliae malle Caesaris concessu quam
ipsorum habere beneficio—tali modo accusatus ad

(L. 0.. iii, 1506-7)‚ the subjunctives are due to Attraction of
Mood. Το my mind the necessity of the mood is obvious3 and
I should say that it is used because Caesar is stating a hypothe-
tical case. The meaning of the sentence ut a· . . . ecquosnam
is clear enough, but to translate it into {nglish ιε extra·
ordinarily difficult. Examine this version critimnff* Seeing Α
the rox1m1ty of the two forces, one would have t ought that

the auls were ready to fight and that the chauces were nearly

even ; but any one who detected the disparity in the conditions ¹
would have known that their defiant attitude was mere
bravado ' (or ‘ a mere sham’).

ξ 4. quod . . . possent. The subjunctive shows that Caesar
meant to express the thought that was in the soldiers’ minda:
if he had written poterant, he would metr! have been stating
the fact that the enemy had the hardiho to look the Roman
soldiers in the face.

ξ 5. salute, if the word is genuine, can only beexplained in
{ffgzzffffffsssspzffissaqWzlssizsszsgfflssfflessfflsssssssssssffi
laude3 but the MS. reading can, I thmk, be defended on the
analogy of Β. C„ iii, 26, ξ l—ipsis militibus Ῑιονταηίἰὺηε neque ,
ullum periculum pro salute Caesaris recusantibus. χ
