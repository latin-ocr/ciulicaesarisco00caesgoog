surrounded Alesia: the outer was confined to the plain of
Les Ifiaumes. The circumvallation (74, § 1) had only one
trenc .
eadem does not mean that the trenches were each 15 feet
deep, but that their depth, whatever it may have been, was
equal. The depth of a trench was always less than its breadth.

pedes. A. Klotz (C.S., p. 219) thinks that the towers must
have stood much further apart than 80 feet, especially as
artillery was used (81, ξ 4), and accordingly conjectures that
we should read passus. If, as we may suppose, the pieces of
artillery were in the towers, he is probably nght.
