AGEDINCUM—-ALLOBROGES 405

Again, after the fall of Alesia Caesar ‘directed Labienus to
march . . . into the count of the Sequani '. If Alesia was Mont
Auxois, this order is intel igible: if Alesia was Alaise, Labienus
received orders to go from the country of the Sequani into the
country of the Sequani, and we are forced to suppose that the
country of the Mandubii, in which Alesia was situated, was part
of the country οξ the Sequani Ξ ξεσρηᾱΙγ, Mont Auxois corre-

and better still if in his holidays hc will take the train from the
Gare de Lyon in Paris to the station of Les Laumes-Alesia and
walk up to the top of Mont Auxois. Neitber Alaise nor any
other hill within two days‘ march from any point in the ‘furthest
part of the country of the Lin ones' corresponds in the least
with Caesar‘s description. Third y, excavations which were made
fifty years ago round Mont Auxms and others which have been
made on Mont Auxois within the last few years have revealed
(a) remains of a Gallio town, (b) traces of two lines of earthworks
which correspond with Gaesar's description (69, 72-4) of the
works that he constructed during the blockade‚ (c) various
weapons both Roman and Gallio, as well as numerous bones of
men and of horses, (d) five barbed spikes such as Caesar describes
under the name of stimuli (73, ξ 9), (e) Gallio pottery, and (f)
619 coins, one of which bears the ima e d superscription of
Vercingetorix. of these coins 132 re man, 487 Gallie.
None of the former are of a later date than 52 Β. 0., the year of
the siege. The latter include specimens belonging to twenty·
four tribes,-more than half of those that sent contingents to
the army which attempted to relieve Vercingetorix (75, ἕξ 2-4) ;
no less than 103 belonged to the Arverni,-— the countrymen of
Vercingetorix; and, like most of the bones, all the coins were
found in the trenches of the camp on Mont Rea, which, assuming
that Alesia was on Mont Auxois, must have been the scene of
the final strug le (83, ξ 2). Fourthly, a Gallie inscription, in
which occurs t e word ALIJSIA— the Gallio form of the name
which Caesar called Alesia—has been discovered in Alise-Sainte-
Reine. Lastly, in the territory which, assumin that Alesiawas
on Mont Auxois, belonged to the Mandubii (6 , ξ 1), there has
been found an inscription, now preserved in the museum of
Dijon, containing the name Mandu-bicos, a spelling which
agrees with the Μανδιβοῦλων of Strabo, iv, 2,§ 3 (Ο. G„ pp. 354-

and Lyons (11, ξ 5); their territory was conterminous with the
territories of the Vocontii, the Segusiavi, and the Nantuates
(6,§ 3; 10, ξ 5; iii, 1, ξ 1; 6, § 5); and their chief towns were
Geneva (i, 6, ξ 3 , Vienna, or Vienne (Ptolemy, Geoyr„ ii, 10, ξ 7),
and Cularo, or renoble (Cicero, Fam„ x, 23, ξ 10). lt is clear,
then, that the greater part of their territory lay between the
Rhene, the Isere, and the Lake of Genera. The boundary which
separated them on the southern bank of the lake from the
Nantuates (iii, 1, ξ 1) coincided, at least approximately‚ with
the eastern boundary of the diocese of Geneva (Ο. G„ pp. 363—5).
