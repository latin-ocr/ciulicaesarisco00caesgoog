Gauls are usually accompanied by a great multitude of wagonS,
even when they are campaigning', and Β. G„ i, 51, ξ l.

19, ξ 1. Collis . . . pedibus L. If I am right in concluding
that Vercingetorix's first camp (16, ξ 1) was north or north-east
of Avaricum, the hill was of course on the same side; but it
cannot be located exactly (C. G„ pp. 743-4).

Dr. Paul Mengc has argued that m the affair which is described
in ch. 18-19 Caesar was outwitted by Vercingetorix. He seems
to have acted simply on the statements of prisoners (18, 1);
and Menge insiste that if he had ascertained beforehan the
strength of the hill which the Gauls had occu ied, he would
never have dreamed of attacking it. clearly, enge remarkS,
the object of Vercingetorix was to eutice Caesar to attempt an
attack in order that the Gauls might be encouraged by his
ignominious failure3 and the speech which is reported in ch. 20
proves that he had set a trap for his enemy (0. G„ pp. 744-5).

ξ 2. pon-tibus here means ‘ causeways ¹.

saltus. I obelize the word rather than adopt the very doubtful
emendation, transitus. Saltus must either mean ‘ thickets’‚
which would have afforded cover to the Gauln, or ‘ lades ’, that
is to say, open spaces by which the Romans woul have tried
to crosa the marsh. Ῐ do not see how it can mean the latter;
for if so, saltus and vada would be identical, and saltus would be
superfluous. On the other hand, the thickets, if they existed,
were surely on the hill. If, then, saltus is right, saltus eius
paludis must mean ‘the thiekets that bordei-ed the marsh'3
{gd Ι am not sure that such a meaning can be got out of the

tin.
