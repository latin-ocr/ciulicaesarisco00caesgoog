GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX

Τ116 Itinerary of Antonine and the Table of Peutinyer are often
referred to in this Index. They were road-books, compiled under
the Roman Empire, which stated the distances, reckoned in
Gallie leagues, each of which was equivalent to one Roman
mile and a half, from town to town. The edition of the Itinerary
from which 1611611 11016 is that of Wesseling; of the Table that
of Desjardins. isba 16160 refer occasionally to Ο. Seeck’s edition
of the Notitia provinciarum.

It must be remembered that the Roman mile was shorter than
the English mile. Its length, neglecting a small fraction, was
ll‚({¹l'7 yard(s, 11εᾶ that a{goRoman miles were nearly equal to 12 Eng-

is ones C. ., . J.

At the time wffen the Itae'nerary of Antonine was compiled most
of the chief Gallie towns had two 11611166,-1116 old Gallie name
and the name of the tribe in whose territory the town was
situated. In the Itinemry the old names were used ς 11111 11 was
from the others that the modern names were derived (C. G„
p. 407, n. 3). Thus Par-1⁸8, the old Gallie name of which was
Lutecia, is derived from the 1111161 1161116, Pam'sii 3 Rom-93³ is
derived from Bituriqes, but its old name was Avaricum3 Amicus,
the old name of which was Samarobriva, is derived from Ambiani .
The great Gallie 'towns having been thus identified, it becomes
easy 10 identify many of 1116 166661 towns mentioned in the
itineraries. For instance, a town called Brivodurum is men·
tioned in the Itinerary of Antonine (p. 367), and its distance
from Cenabum was 38 Gallie leagues. Cenabum, otherwise
called Aureliani, is known to have been Orleans3 and the dis·
tance identifies Brivodurum with Briare.

When the reader looks at the map he will see that the boun·
dai-ies of most of the tribes are traced 3 and if, as 1 110 6, 116 16
determined to test, as far as 116 6611, 1116 1111111 of what say, he
will ask himself, How does Holmes know what the boundaries
were ⁶? Well, I frankly admit that, exce t in a very few cases,
where there is ditect evidence, 1 do not now,——precisely: but
I can ’ve satisfactory reasons for believing that the frontiers
which have traced are approximately correct; and 1 thought
that this amount of information would be better than none.
When 1116 provinces of Gaul were organized by Au stus, sixty
tribal cantens, or civitates, were recognized 3 an , generally
speakin ‚ the boundaries of these civitates were the same as
they h been in the time of Caesar. At a later time, when
(3111161161111)1 was adopted as the religion of the Gauls, the boun-
daries of the civitates generally became the boundaries of 1116
episcopal dioceses, though here and there a large civitas com-
prised more than 0116 diocese. The reader will understand that
