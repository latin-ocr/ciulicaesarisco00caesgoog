COMMENTARIUS V 191

rent. Nostri acriter in eos impetu facto reppulerunt 3
neque finem sequendi fecerunt, quoad subsidio confisi
equites, cum post se legiones viderent, praecipites 4
hostes egerunt magnoque eorum numero interfecto
5 neque sui colligendi neque consistendi aut ex essedis
desiliendi facultatem dederunt. Ex hac fuga protinus 5
quae undique convenerant auxilia discesserunt, neque

post id tempus umquam summis nobiscum copiis hostes
contenderunt.

and do not be satisfied with thc translation ‘ from the standards
and the legions’, which is not only hideous but does not ex·
press Gaesar’s meaning.

4. sui colliqendi. See the note on iii, 6, ξ 1.

5. :nammis is here equivalent to universis or cunctim and the
sense is (from that time the enemy never encountered us) ‘in a
general action ’.

18, ξ 1. Caesar . . . duxit. Caesar must have marched either
by the trackway on the line of which the Romans afterwards
made the road called Watling Street, or along the southern
slope of the chalk escarpment and across the Medway at Ayles-
ford or Halling. All the Roman and pre-Roman antiquities
that have been discovered in Kent, west of a line drawn from
Reculver through Canterbury and Lympne to Romney‚ have
come from sites clustering along these routes (A. B., p. 344).

quod flumen . . . transiri potest. Although numerous attempta
have been made, it is impossible to determine the spot where
Caesar crossed the Thames. There are only two places for
which a shred of real argument has been adduced.—‘Goway
Stakes ’, about a furlong west of Walton Bridge‚ and Brentfoid.
‘ Coway Stakes ’ is close to Halliford; and Dr. Ε. Guest pointed
out that between Hurleyford (about 2} miles west of Great
Marlow) and the sea Halhford is the only place ‘bearing a name
which indicates a ford over it ’. But that name originated
after the Anglo·Saxon invasion ; and we do not know whether
there was a ford near Halliford in the time of Caesar. At
Brentford a line of stakes, which Mr. Montagu Sharpe iden-
tifies with the acutis sudibus of § 3, extended some 30 or
40 years ago for about a mile up the river from a point
opposite the mouth of the Brent; and he shows that ‘ no other
ancient stakes have been discovered in the lower river during
dredging operations’: but of course it cannot be proved that
the stakes in question were those which Caesar mentione. In-
deed the latter must have been displaced or their points sawn
off by the Romans, though the ford may have been staked
