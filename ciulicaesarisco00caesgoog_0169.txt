cum pro se quisque in conspectu imperatoris etiam
in extremis suis rebus operam navare cuperet, paulum
hostium impetus tardatus est.

ut paulatim sese legiones coniungerent et conversa

ab novissae'mv’s here and in §2 does not mean ⁴ m the rear
ranks’, but ‘in the rear ranks’: in other wo s, ab has the
same force as in a fmnte (‘ in front') and ab utroque latere
(‘on either flank’).

subeuntes and intermittere are closely connected in sense.

ξ 2. manipulos tamar-e. In re to the maniples see p. lxiii.
The three maniplos of each co ort probably always stood side
by side, not one behind another (0. G„ p. 588). As the cohorts
were huddled together (ξ 1), the only way, as far as 1 can see,
of opening out the ranke would have been to make every other
man in the front rank step foi-ward.

26, ξ 1. et conversa siqua . . . inferrent. The exact meaning of
these words is uncertain. In 24, ξ 4 Caesar says that the 7th and
12th legions were almost surrounded, and in 25, ξ l that the
Nervii were attacking the 12th in front and on either fiank. It
seems clear, then, that the object of the formation which he
describes was to enable the two legions to face the enem on
all sides. They certainly had to repel attacks in front an on
either flank3 and Caesar says (26,§ 2) that when they had
effected the movement which he ordered, they no longer
feared an attach in the rear. F. Giesing remarks that it was
only necessary for the rear companies of the two legions to turn
round and for the win companies to make a quartu-turn, thus
forming a closed para lelogram. Probably he is right3 but it

is enough to get a clear general idea of Caesar‘s meaning
(C. G„ pp. 676-7).
