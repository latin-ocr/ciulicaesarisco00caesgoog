Bibracte.

lii INTRODUCTION

intel-tribal relations, their manners and customs, and
perhaps occasionally their religion. Thus, while the
extreme rarity of Arvernian coins in the great mart of
Bibracte may perhaps be explained by the traditional
enmity between the Arverni aud the Aedui, the dis-
coveries of British coins in Gaul and of Gallie coins in
Britain attest the maritime trade which Caesar notices;
coins of Central Europe found as far west as Saintonge
and Gallie coins found in the Bohemian stronghold of
Stradonic prove that the Gauls had intercourse with the
valley of the Danube ; Massilian coins found in various
parts of Gaul bear witness to the enterprise of the Greek
colony ς and numerous hoards of silver coins of one type,
all of which have been found in the basin of the Garonne,
confirm the impression which we derive from the Gom·
montaries that the relations of Aquitania were mainly
with Spain. Again, when we notice that horses and
swine are figured on Gallie coins more frequently than
any other animab, we are reminded of the passage¹ in
which Caesar observes that the Gauls imported well-bred
horses at great eost, aud of the passage in which Strabo ²
speaks of the hams which the Sequani exported to Italy.
Shields and trumpets remind us of Diodorus’s ³ descrip-
tion of Gallie arms 3 and the lyre, which is figured on
certain coins, may represent the instrument with which
the bards accompanied their songs. It is remarkable
that all the coins which have been found in the great
strongholds are of late date—not earlier than about a
hundred years before the Christian era—which tends to
show that none had been founded more than half a cen·
tury before Caesar entered Gaul. Probably Avaricum,
Bibracte, Lutecia, and the other towns which he men·
tiens were fortified during the invasion of the Cimbri
and Teutoni, which devastated Gaul between 113 and

1025& these towns the one which is best known to us

was Bibracte, described by Caesar as ‘ by far the wealthiest
and most important town of the Aedui ’, which stood
upon Mont Beuvray, a few miles west of Autun. If
