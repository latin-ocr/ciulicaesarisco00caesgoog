430 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX

Only one objection is worth noticing here. The rincipal Gallio
towns did not, as a rule, exchange their names or those of the
tribes to which they belon ed (for example, Lutecia became
Pan'sii) before the close of e third century, and by that time
the Sotiates were incorporated with the Elusates3 accordingly
it has been argued that the name of the town which Oramus
captured could never have been effaoed by the name Sotiates,
and therefore that the town was not identical with Sos. But
the answer is easy. The Tricasses, who are not mentioned by
Caesar, were incorporated with the Senones; et Aaou-stomun,
the name of their chief town, was effaced by e name Triones·
(Troyes). See 0. G„ pp. 474-7, one argument in which is
here modified.

Suessiones. —The Suessiones possessed the diocese of
Soissons, that is to say, the greater part of the department
of the Aisne, and probably also the dmcese of Senlis, formed
out of the territory of the Silvanectes, -who were between them
and the Bellovaci. Caesar implies (ii, 13, ξ 1) that the terri-
tories of the Bellovaci and the Suessiones were conteminous,
and he does not mention the Silvanectes in his list of the Belgio
tribes (4, §§ 5-10). We may therefore infer that they were
dependants of or included among either the Bellovaci or the
Suessiones; and as the latter, according to Caemr (4,§ 6), had
a very extensive territory, the diocese of Senlis probably be-
longed to them 0. G.. pp. 397, 477).

sugambri.— 'his German tribe dwelt between the river Sieg,
which reserves their name, and the Lippe. It would appear,
then, t at the territory of the Ubii, who were south o the
Sugambri (iv, 18, ξ 2; 19, §1), was bounded on the north by
the Sieg; but some writers maintain that they also possessed
a strip of land north of the Sieg as far as Cologne and between
the Rhine and the Sugambri. If so, the Sugambri must have
crossed their territory in 53 Β.ο. when they made their raid
into the country of the Eburones (vi, 35, ξς 4-6). But do not
Caesar's words, Suqambm· qui sunt prm-im· Rheno, prove that
&ex cggssecll thedlthinle1 irgulnediately from their own territory?

'l'arbe '.—The territory of the Tarbelli, according to Ptolemy
(Gema, ii, 7, ᾗ 8), extended southward from the frontier of the
Bituriges Vivisci to the Pyrenees and therefore included the
territories of the Cocosates and the Sibusates. 'Phe Tarbelli
were really separated from the Bituriges Vivisci by the Boiates.
who are not mentioned by Caesar3 but under the Roman
Empire several smaller tribes, of whom the Boiates were prob·
abl one, were evidently annexed to the Tarbelli and grouped
wit them under their name ; and even in Gaesar’s time certain
tribes whom he does not name may have been included with
them (C'. G„ pp. 4774>

Tarusates—The arusates are generally believed to have
been identical with the Aturenses, who are not mentioned by
Caesar, and who possessed the country round Aire (Atura).
Some writers believe that the district of Tursan in the diocese
of Aire preserves their name; while others place them, for the
, same reason, in the neighbourhood of Tartas, which is about
15 miles north-east of Dax (0. G.. pp. 479-80). See vocum
