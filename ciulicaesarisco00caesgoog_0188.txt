Veneti; but that the Germane could have been induced to
march 600 miles in order to help an Atlantic tribe is incredible.
The Belgae rebelled in 54-53 Β.ο., and they might rebel in 56.
At all events, Labienus was sent to look aster them; and as he
only had to prevent the Germans from crossing a broad river,
the force which Caesar assigned to him was enough. whether ἲ
Caesar wrote Belgis or Gallis, I am sure that he meant the Belgae. ·

ᾗ 3. ne ex his . . . coniungantur. Mommsen remarks H. R„
v, 1895, p. 500, note) that Caesar's attempt to justi the
invasion of Aquitania ‘ as a defensive measure which the state
of thin had rendered inevitable ’ breaks down. It is generally
assum that the danger which Caesar professed to sear did
not exist, because the Aquitani had a parently no political
connexion with the Celtae and the Be gae, and were in race
distinct from both: but vii, 31, ξ 5, where we learn that
Vercingetorix was reinforced by Aquitanian cavalry, shows
that the dan r was real; and is it quite certain that it was
not lessened y the defeats which Crassus inflicted upon the
Aquitani? And if the danger was insignificant‚ is it certain
that Caesar knew it to be so ⁸? If Mommsen is right, why did
Caesar make no excuse for having sent Crassus to reduce the mari·
time tribes, who had offered him no provocation, to submission ⁸?
Surely because it never occurred to him that his conduct
required an apology.

ξ 5. D. Brutum adulescevuem. See the note on 7,§ 2. Although
Brutus was entrusted with the command of the fleet, it is
doubtful whether he had at this time the rank of legatusz sor,
like P. Crassus, he was not yet a senator.

ἲ. The MS. reading is possen but, as Meusel says (J. B„
18 , . 371), it is extremely improbable that Caesar, having
used t e present sub'unctive seven times in one paragraph aster
a historic present, ould have changed the tense without the
slightest reason.

eo. Meusel may be right in believing that Caesar wrote ι
eodem. Of. L. 0., ii, 28 with 840-5.
