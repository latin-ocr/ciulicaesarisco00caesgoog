COMMENTARIUS II 7 9

fecit ; T. Labienum legatum cum legionibus tribus
subsequi iussit. Hi novissimos adorti et multa milia 4
passuum prosecuti magnam multitudinem eorum fu-
gientium conciderunt, cum ab extremo agmine, ad
5 quos ventum erat, consisterent fortiterque impetum
nostrorum militum sustinerent, priores, quod abesse 5
8 periculo viderentur neque ulla necessitate neque
imperio continerentur, exaudito clamore perturbatis
ordinibus omnes in fuga sibi praesidium ponerent.

10 Ita sine ullo periculo tantam eorum multitudinem 6
nostri interfecerunt quantum fuit diei spatium; sub
occasum solis sequi destiterunt seque in castra, ut erat
imperatum, receperunt.

Postridie eius diei Caesar, prius quam se hostes ex 12 He-

15 terrore ac fuga reciperent, in fines Suessionum, qui ξζξζξιῑᾶθξθ-

proximi Remis erant, exercitum duxit et magno itinere ceives tho

§ 4. Hi . . . conciderunt. Meusel (J. B.. 1910, pp. 45-6) brackets
these words, arguing that they are contradicted by the follow-
ing clause, cum . . . sustinerent. He also asks whether the novis·
simi were different from the eaetremum aymm, and whether the
priores of § 5 were the vanguard and indeed the greater part of
the fugitive column or only the leading division of the rear·
guard (novissimi). If, however, Hi . . . conciderunt was not
written by Caesar, ponerent (ξ 5) is plainl wrong; and accord-
ingly Meusel alters it into ponebant: but e is obliged to admit
that in this case (priores) quod ought to be followed by the
indicative. In fact all the attempts that have been made to
amend the passage fail. As far as 1 can see, no alteration is
needed: for extremo aymine deuotes the same men as novissi-
mos; pm‘ores denotes all the rest; cum is causal and introduces
two reasons for the slaughter which is described by magnam
multitudinem . . . concidor-unm and the words which Meusel
brackets are justified by§ 6.

ξ 5. viderentur. . . continerentur. See the note on i, 6, ξ 3.
Videre-ntur is equivalent to sibi viderentur.

make it clear that the second ablativo absolute is the result
of the first. I should say ‘broke their ranks when they heard
the distant eries ’-

12, § 1. Postridie. . . contendit. Confecto, as Nipperdey first saw,
is certainly spurious ; for, as no place is indicated as the terminus
of the magnum iter, it has no meaning; and, moreover‚ postridie

retain confecto might, indeed, put this question z—‘Supposing
