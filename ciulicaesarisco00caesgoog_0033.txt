THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL xxvii

the individuale whose physical features are unfamiliar
and ignore the rest. Thus a modern English traveller
hastily remarks that Scotsmen have red hair and red
beards3 while a trained observor, having entered in his
note-book all the observatione that he has been able to
make, reports that in certain districts most Scotsmen are
dark‚ while in that part of Scotland in which fairness
is most conspicuous, not more than eleven per cent. of the
people have red hair. still, the proportion of blonde
people in Gaul was certainly much greater than in
modern France3 and we have to account for the differ·
ence. First, it must be remembered that a great many
Gauls perished in Caesar-’s wars or were sold into slavery3
and of those who were thus lost to the country a number
disproportionately large probably belonged to the domi·
nant rece, by whose great stature he was so impressed.
Second ly, except in comparatively cold climates, the tall
fair type is less successful in the struggle for existence
than the dark. Thirdly, there is reason to believe that
the fair type is less able than the dark to resist the
unhealthy conditions of the slums in crowded cities.
Fourthly, in families of which one parent is fair and the
other dark, the proportion of dark children is generally
greater than the proportion of fair. Lastly, a mixed
population tends to revert to the type which was at the
beginning that of the majority. There is little doubt,
then, that since the time of Caesar, although France has
‘boen invaded by Franks, Visigoths‚ Alani, smus,
Burgundians, and Normans‚ among all of whom fairness
and tall stature we're conspicuous, the dark type has been
gaining ground upon the fair. No observant person who
knows the outlines of English history will be surprised
at this. The Saxons, Angles‚ and J utes who conquered
Britain were at least as fair as the Celts3 they settled
among a people of whom the dominant clement in Caesar’s
time had been, as it was in Gaul, Celtic; and they killed
a good many of them. Afterwards they were themselves
conquered by Danes and Normans‚ among whom fairness

was also common. But the dark clement, which had
existed in prehistoric Britain as in prehistoric Gaul,
