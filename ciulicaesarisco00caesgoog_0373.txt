Meusel prefers, is only found in two inferior MSS. and in the
Aldine edition (1513). If it is ri ht, the meanin is that
the Gauls reinforced the garrison ‘ ecause they rea ized that
final success depended almost entirely u on their holding the
town ’. This would have been a reasonab e motive: but we are
told that the Gauls generally, not Vercin torix, were res on·
sible for the reinforcement3 and, acco ing to the re ing

destinaverant. See the second note on ii1, 12, ξ 1.

tormentis here means ‘windlasses’. The word is used in
a different sense in 41, ξ 3 and 81, ξ 4.

terrace on which they stood, the Gauls matched their height
by adding new stories to their own towers. Some writers,
indeed, have supposed that aqqer does not here mean the
terrace, but the material (timber) which was used for increasing
the hei ht of the Roman towers. But in all the other pas es
in whic aqyer means ‘ material ’ the meanin is unmistakab ος
