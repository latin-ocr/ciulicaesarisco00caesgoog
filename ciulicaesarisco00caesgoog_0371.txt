ipse sine is Th. Bentley’s emendation of the MS. reading,
ignum, which Schneider defends. Vercingetorix, he argues,
meant that the hill (19, ξ 1) was so strongly situated that it
defended not only Avaricum (indirectly) but also itself, whereas,
if ipse were right, we should be left in doubt how the fact that
the hill required no defendere induced Vercingetorix to approach
nearer Avaricum. As far as I can see, Vercingetorix was not
thinking of Avaricum at all ; and in such phrases Caesar
generally uses the nominative of ipse.

Meusel, in his school edition (1908), reads essent, bnt in 5, ξ 5
and other analo ous sentences he retains the primary tense.

the primary tense may be explained by the fact that a rescnt
infinitive, habendam, follows the perfect infinitives of ξξ 3-5.
See ᾗ 4 and the note on 5, ξ 5.

ξ . posset. Meusel (J. B„ 1894, p. 364) is perhaps right in
adopting the reading of β, possit, and therefore also in changing
the following esset into sit.

I am not quite sure whether the first sibi is singular or, as
Schneider thinks, plural, meaning Vercingetorix himself and
the troops who were then under his command. He says that if
it is singular, it is difficult to understand why Caesar added atque
