the culture of Hallstatt had given place to that which
takes its name from the village of La Tene, at the north·
ern eud of the lake of NeuchateL where, some sixty
years ago, was discovered a precious series of antiquitieS.
The art, essentially Celtic, characterized by the tasteful
use of curves, which was practised in the design and
decoration of these objects, was in part an out-growth of
that of Hallstatt, but also owed much to classical and
even to oriental influences. Imported into Britain by
the Brythonic invaders, it there shook itself free from all
trammels, and attained an even higher level than in Gaul,
culminating in the graceful and exquisitely decorated
shield of bronze and red enamel which adorna the Cen·
tral Saloon of our National Museum. Specialists have
determined three periods, known as La Tene Ι, ΙΙ, and
111, of which the last began about forty years before the
proconsulship of Caesar. By that time the Gallie peoples
had all risen far above the condition of barbarians ; while
the Celticans of the interior had attained a certain degree
of civilization and even of luxury. Their trousers, from
which the Province took its name of Gallia Braccata,
and their many-coloured tartan shirts and cloaks excited
the astonishment of their conquerere. The chiefs wore
rings and bracelets aud necklaces of gold3 and when
those tall fair-haired warriors rode forth to battle with
their helmets wrought in the shape of some fierce beast’s
head and surmounted by nodding plumes, their chain
armour, their long bucklerS, and their clanking swords,
they made a splendid show. About fifty years before
Caesar-'s time, war-chariots‚ which had excited the
astonishment of the Romans in the battle of Telamon,
and which were still used in Britain, had fallen into dis·
use, probably because the wealthy natives had begun to
impert horses powerful enough for a charge of cavalry ;
but from the older graves of the department of the
Marne, which have yielded numerous remains of these
cars, bronze horse-trappings of most delicate open-work
and bronze flagons which had been fetched from Greece
have been unearthed. The arts of building and of fortifi-
cation had made a considerable advance. Walled towns
