originally written by a reader above the as o ascensu, in order
to show that exscensu was meant, which denotes ascending with
effort or scrambling up3 or, he thinks, Caesar may have written
e(oe)scensu, and a copyist may inadvertently have written the

Caesar was, but from Gresigny, where there was a Roman
cavalry camp, rather more than a mile north-east of Labienus's
position3 for if they had ridden round the outer lines by the
east, they would have reached the scene of action too late, and
if they had crossed the plain of Les Laumes, they would have had
to encounter a large part of the relieving army, both cavalry and
infantry, on the way (83, ξ 8). lf I am right, Caesar probably
sent the order to Gresigny‚ not by signals (which would have been
invisible because Mont Auxois obstructed the view), but by a
