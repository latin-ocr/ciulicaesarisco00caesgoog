25, ξ 1. pluteos turrium. The pluteus, as described by
vegetius (De re mil„ iv, 15), which was used to protect soldiers
when they were constructing siege works (see the note on
ii, 30, ξ 3), was a eonvex wicker shield with an arehed roos and
running on three rollers; but plutei of another kind, which
were breastworks used occasionall to stren hen earthworks,
are mentioned in 41, ξ 4 and 72, §y 4. To w ich kind did the
plutei tum-ium belong? Some writers think that they were
mantlets which screened the men who moved the towers; others
that they were breastworks attached to the towers for the

consumed the towers themselves (C. G„ pp. 600-1) ⁶?

cruditas sebi ac picis, and this order is better; but that seems
hardly a sufficient reason for disregarding the MSS.

e raficam—⁴ opposite ’. Reqio here means ⁸ line’ or ⁴ direction ';
and the meaning of e reqione, which is explained by Cicero (De
Natura Deorum, ii, 40, ξ 103), is self·evident in other passages of
this &qk-35· §§ 1-23136& ὃς 58, ξ ⁶: See-C. G„ pp. 779-30.

its construction is not exactly known (C. G„ pp. 582-3); but no
doubt the principle was the same as that of tormenta in general.
