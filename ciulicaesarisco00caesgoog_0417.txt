COMMENTARIUS VII 329

dinem tumultuari et magnum ire agmen adverso

ξ 4. atque omnes . . . parare. Meusel (J. Β.. 1910, p. 53; 1912,
pp. 72-3) follows von Goler in bracketing these words; for, he
argues, when the Gauls heard [Caesar says ‘thou ht ⁹] that the
Romans were croseing the Seine at three places, t ey must have
believed that they were going to attach them. Granted; but sor
all that they must have seen that Labienus was ‘ preparing for
ssight’ in the sense that he had abandoned his offensive campaign,
antd that his only object in fighting was to clear the way for
re reat.

ᾗ 5. parva manu. Though Camulo enus was perplexed, it is
evident that Labienus's stratagem onffy artially succeeded.

Navis is a geuene term, which may enote either a ship or
a small boat; and the naves mentioned here were the same as
the lintres (60, ξ 4) which had been rowed upstream in the
direction of Meclosedum. Similarly we often speak of an
Atlantic liner as a ⁴ boat ' (C. G„ pp. 782-4).

62, ξ 2. praesentem is omitted in Se and is bracketed, 1 think
rightly, by Meusel. See vi, 8, ξ 4.
