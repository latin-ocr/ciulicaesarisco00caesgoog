9. ξ 1. post diem tertium is equivalent to tertio die (cf. vi, 33,
ξ 4 with 36,§ 1 and 41, ξ 2), and, as the Romans commonly,
though not always, reckoned inclusively, if the envoys said this
on a Monday, they meant that they would return on Wednes-
day. But this does not explain wh Caesar wrote post diem
tertium instead of tertio die. See t 0 note on 28‚§ 1. I am
rather inclined to think that, just as post horam nonam (v, 53,
§D means ‘after the ninth hour'‚ post diem tertium (though
it is equivalent to tertio die) here implies the meanin ‘at
the end of the third day '. Such a meaning is most pro ably
implied in one of the other two passages (iv, 28,§ 1) 1n which
Caesar uses post diem with a numeral ad'ective (see A. B„

Μο0001 arguesg that the description of the Rhine is irrelegvant;
that the Mense rises not in the Vosges, but on the plateau of
Langres‚ both of which regions Caesar had visited; that the
Vosges mountains are not infinibus Ia'nyonum( l); that strong
reasons have been given for believing that the atavi [who are
not mentioned by Strabo] did not occupy the delta of the Rhine
before the time of Augustus; that the Rhine did not flow through
the country of the Nantuates ( ξ 3) ; 11101 1110 geographical osition

that, 00 the Menapii possessed both banks of the Rhine ‘ not far

for the Batavi and the ‘ fierce rude tribes ’ who are said to have
occupied ‘ man y' of the ‘ numerous large islands ’ς 11101 Caesar
would not have written parte quadam ex Rheno (ξ 1), but parte
Rheni ; and, finally, that caput fluminis [in prose of Caesar's
time] means not the mouth, but the source of a river. Klotz
remarks that Caesar would have written lonyius immediately
before milibus passuum LXXX (ξ 2); and that he would not
have used the quasi-poetical expression, citatus fertur (ξ 3), or
