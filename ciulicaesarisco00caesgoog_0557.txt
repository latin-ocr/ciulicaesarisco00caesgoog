CORRIGENDA AND ADDENDA 461

iiii, 9, 52. interea. Even in an English translation ‘meanwhile' might
conveniently come first in the sentence3 for, though interea
properly belongs to moveret, it also serves as a connecting
particle. If it had been placed aster ne, another particle
would be indispensable.

ll, 5 1. orabam. Schneider remarks that if the envoys had made only
one request, and not also that denoted by petebant, Caesar
would have written orarenmt.1 doubt it. cf. vii, 78, 5 4.
The imperfect seems to me to show that the request' was
urgently reiterated.

²⁸21, 5 7. The mere fact that Commius was ari-ested on landing (27, 5 8)
proves nothing, for the tribes of South·Eastern Brit-ain were
divided into antagonistic groups (Δ.Β., p. 300), and if
Caesar wrote his, not iis (which is constantly confounded
with it), his romanibus may mean North-Baetem Gaul and
&ath-Bastern Britain, which were united by the closest
ties (ib. ., pp. 299- 3-00).

*21, 5 9. auderet. It has been said that the legionaries on board the galley
could have protected Volusenus! What sort of a fight could
a few legionaries have made? Volusenus, with all his
faults, was no coward.

¹⁸23, 5 3. anqustis. 1 might have added that, as Meusel himself remarks,
promati (ii, 29, 5 4) is poetical, and that Caesar uses brevitas
(ii, 30, 5 4) in a sense which is elsewhere only found in
poete and late writers.

31, 52. ‚ti-amentum. Though standing corn is generally denoted by the
plural, there' is an exception in iv, 32, 54. Perhaps, how·
ever, as Meusel suggests, the corn which Caesar‘ brought in
daily from the fields' had already been cut and stacked by
the Britons.

¹⁸33, 5 3. per temonem . . . consuerint. Meus-el, remarking that uti in declivi
. . . flectere undoubtedly refers to the drivers, maintains that
they, and not the warriors, must have run along the pole.
What for? They were not performing in a circus. The
earlier words, lta mobilitatem . . . in proeliis, evidently refer to
the warriors as well as the drivers 3 and it is clear that the
subject of tho whole sentence is essedarii, i. e. warriors and
drivers. Which of the two is to be thought of as the subject
of each verb, is left to the reader’s common sense.

¹¹34, 5 1. perturbatis iios. ris. Meusel, who agrees with me, remarks that
with auoetlmm serre Caesar generally uses a dative.

34, 5 5. micatus includes essedarii (38, 5 1.)

v, 1, 5 2. Schneider argues that nosiro mari, by which most readers would
assume that Caesar meant the Mediterranean, was only that
part ot it which lay between Italy and Spain. but the

which he cites (Sallust, Juyuriha, 17, 5 4· , 18, 5 4· ,
Livy, xxvi. 42, 5 4 ; xxviii, 1, 5 3) only prove tha't the
Western Mediterranean was part of nostrum mare 3 long before
Caesar’s time the Eastern Mediterranean had been a highway
of traffic with Italy 3 and Pomponius Mela (i, 1, 55 6-7) says
that the whole expanse between the Straits of Gibraltar and
the Sea of Azof was called Nostrum mare. Besides, is
Schneider was right, Caesar distinguished between the ships
that sailed the Western Mediterranean and those that were
used in the various waters os the East‚ which is improbable·
reliquis maribus means all the waters navigated by the

’ - Romans, except the Atlantic.
