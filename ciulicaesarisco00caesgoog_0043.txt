thick. I placed the workmen, with their picks and
shovels, in several rows fff . . . , at right angles to one
of the supposed sides of the camp. Each of them had to
turn up the layer of productive soil along a space two feet
wide. If, after turning up the layer to a depth of
70 centimetres, they felt their picks strike unyielding
ground, that showed that the ground had never been

disturbed and that they were not on the Roman ditch.

when they unmistakably reached the ditch at xy, the
case was different. Then, after turning up the soil to
the depth of 70 centimetreS, they no longer found them-

they met with loose soil, which broke easily,—a sign
that it had formerly been disturbed. 1 then enlarged the
“ trench '' (tranchdc)——the space that was to be excavated—
giving it a width of six feet (cd) instead of two (x y), to
enable the men to work more easily; and they dug out
the “ trench'’ till they came to the bedrock. One could
soon tell, for another reason, whether one was on the
Roman ditch or not3 for, if one was really there, one
could make out without difficulty on the two edges,
ec and fd, of the ‘⁴ trench ”the outline of the ditch, which
was recognizable by the colour of the mixed earth—that
of the old rampart-contrasted with the colour of the
virgin soil that surrounded it.
