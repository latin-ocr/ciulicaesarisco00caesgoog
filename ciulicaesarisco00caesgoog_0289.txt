COMMENTARIUS V 207

accedant et, quam in partem Romani impetum fece-
rint, cedant, levitate armorum et cotidiana exercita- 4
tione nihil his noceri posse, rursus se ad signa reci-
pientes insequantur.

5 Quo praecepto ab iis diligentissime observato, cum 35
quaepiam cohors ex orbe excesserat atque impetum
fecerat, hostes velocissime refugiebant. Interim eam 2
partem nudari necesse erat et ab latere aperto tela
recipere. Rursus, cum in eum locum unde erant 3

10 progressi reverti coeperant, et ab iis qui cesserant et
ab iis qui proximi steterant circumveniebantur; sin 4
autem locum tenere vellent, nec virtuti locus relinque-
batur neque ab tanta multitudine coniecta tela conferti
vitare poterant. Tamen tot incommodis conflictati 5

15 multis vulneribus acceptis resistebant et magna parte
diei consumpta, cum a prima luce ad horam octavam
pugnaretur, nihil quod ipsis esset indignum committe-
bant. Tum T. Balventio, qui superiore anno primurn 6
pilum duxerat, viro forti et magnae auctoritatis,

ξ 4. levitate . . . posse. Levites, says Meusel (J. B., 1910, p. 52),
is not used in classical prose in the sense of lightness of weight,
and, even if it were, Caesar would not have written levitate3
but propter levitatem. The former ar ment appears to me
weak; brevitas, which Caesar (ii, 30, 5¹4) uses ln the sense
of shortness of stature, does not occur elsewhere with that
meanin before the time of the elder Plin ; and when I read
ii, 1, ξ and iii, 21, ξ 3, Ι doubt whether aesar would neces·
sarily have written propter levitatem. Perhaps, as Meusel argues,
the words might be dispensed with ς but Ι do not think that the
reasons for bracketing them are sufficient.

35, ξ 2. eam panem,— i. e. cohortem.

ab latere aperto. See the note on i, 25, ξ 6.

ξ 3. coeperant. See the note on 19, ξ 2.

ξ 4. vellent. The subjunctive leaves it uncertain whether the
soldiers did or did not intend to hold their ground; and it is
necessarily followed by an indicative (relinquebatur) : for if
Caesar had written relictus esset, he would have meant that they
had had no such intention. See J. Β., 1894. p. 374.

5. mum-etur. See the note on iii, 5, ξ 1.

6. qui su eriora . . . dume-mc is equivalent to qm· primipilus
fuerat (see t e note on ii, 25, ξ 1 [pm'mipiloDz in other words,
Balventius had in the previous year been the chief centurion of
his legion. But why was he not still ⁸? Probably he had served
his full time and was now serving again as an evocatus, or volun·

teer; for it is evident from the way m which Caesar speaks of
him that he had not been degraded (C. 0., pp. 577-8).
