ready ιο listen to him, Casticus, whose father had been
the last king of the Sequani, and Dumnorix, brother of
Diviciacus, who was at that time the most powerful
chieftain of the Aedui. If Diviciacus saw the salvation
of his country in dependence upon Rome, his brother
regarded the connexion with abhorrence. He was able,
ambitione, and rich; and the common people adored
him. Orgetorix urged him and Casticus to seize the
royal power in their respective states, as he intended to
do in his, and promised them armed support. The three
entered into a formal compact for the conquest and par·
tition of Gaul; and, if they had any aim beyond their
own aggrandizement, they may have hoped that their
success would not only checkmate Ariovistus, but stop
the anarchy which paralysed their country and avert the
encroachments of Rome. Their purpose threatened the
republic with a twofold danger. Once they had gone,
the lands which they left vacant would be overrun by
the Germans, who would then be in dangerous proximity
to Italy; and there was no telh‘ng what mischief they
might do in Gaul. Above the din of party strife at
Rome the note of warning was heard. Men talked
anxiously of the prospecte of war; and the Senate sent
commissionem to dissuade the Gallie peoples from joining
the invaders. But the ambitious triumvirate had still to
reckon with the Helvetii. They heard that their envoy
had broken his trust, and immediately recalled him to
answer for his conduct. He knew that if he were found
guilty, he would be burned alive 3 and accordingly, when
he appeared before his judges, he was followed by his
retainers and slaves, numbering over ten thousand men.
The magistrates, determined to bring him to justice,
called the militia to arms; but in the meantime the

adventui-er died, perhaps by his own hand.
But the idea which he had conceived did not die. The

Helvetii had no intention of abandoning their enterprise,
nor Dumnorix of abandoning his. He had married a

daughter of Orgetorix3 and he was quite ready ιο help
them if they would make it worth his while. They

resolved to spend two years in preparing for their
