armed his retainers, hired a band of mercenariae, won
the support of the populace by eloquence and largess,
and, overthrowing the feeble oligarchy, usurped supreme
power. Thus the oligarchies lived in perpetual unrest:
if no one noble was conspicuously strong, there was
intestine strife; if one could make himself supreme, the
government was overthrown. The populace were per·
haps beginning to have some consciousness of their own
latent strength ; but there is no evidence that anywhere
they had any definite political rights. The Druids and
the nobles, or, as Caesar called them, the knights, enjoyed
a monopoly of power and consideration: the bulk of the
poorer freemen, ground down by taxation and sti-angled
with debt, had no choice but to become seris·

And if in individual tribes there was anarchy‚ want of
unity was the bane of them all. It was not only that
Belgian and Aquitanian and Celtioan were naturally
distinct: the evil was more deeply seated. It is of
course true that disunion is the normal condition of half·
civilized peoples. 'Phe Old English tribes shewed no
genius for combination: it was the strong hand of an
Egbert‚ an Edgar‚ an Athelstan, that laid the foundations
of the English kingdom. Nor was the kingdom united,
except in the loosest sense, even on the eve of the Norman
Conquest. If Harold was formally king over all England,
his subjecta felt themselves Yorkshiremen or men of Kent ·
rather than Englishmen. Moreover, the circumstances of
the Gauls were peculiarly unfortunate. Their patriotism,
if it was latent, was real: they were proud of what their
fathers had achieved in war ; and the sense of nationality
was stirring in their hearts. Caesar himself allows that
some of the tribes were comparatively well governed ;1
and even clientship‚ which after all harassed our own
government until Henry the Seventh stamped it out,
had its noble side. Who does not respect the ‘six
hundred devoted followers' of Adiatunnus,² the four
squires whom neither fear nor favour could induce to
betray Ambiorix,³ and those attendants of Litaviccus who
remembered that ‘Gallic custom brauds it as shameful
