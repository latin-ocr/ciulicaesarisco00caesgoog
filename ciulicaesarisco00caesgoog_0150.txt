8, ἕξ 3-5. We cannot tell where Caesar pitched his camp
until we know where he had crossed the Aisne (5, 84„ and four
points of passage have been proposed, namely, Berry·au-Bac‚
for which most commentatore have decided‚ conde-sur-Suippe,
which is about 3 miles higher up the river, and Pontavert and
Pontarcy‚ which are respectivel about 4 and 11 miles, as the
crow flies, lower down. The c aims of Conde·sur-Suippe and
Pontarey have been disproved.

The reason why Berry·au-Bac is generally accepted is that
about a mile and a half north-east of it, near Manchamp, Colonel
Stoffel discovered by excavation a camp, which he identified
with the camp of Caesar. If the reader will look at the
illustration of this camp, which is substantially identical with
Pl. 8 of the Atlas ofuNapoleon·s Histoire de Jules θέσαν, he will
see that it does not corres nd with Caesar’s description.
According to Caesar, the hil on which the camp stood rose
gradually from level ground on the right bank of the Aisne: it

escended gradually to level ground in frent: its flanks, on the
right and left, descended to the plain with a strongly marked
slope; and its length, or extension from right to left, was just
sufficient to allow six legions to be drawn up on it in line of
battle in sront of the camp. Between the hill and the enemy's
camp, which was in front of it, was a small marsh. In order to
prevent the enemy from outflanking him, Caesar drew a trench
crosswise—that is, at right angles with the extension of the
hill—past either flank of it; and at each end of each trench he
constructed a redoubt. Before Stoffel began to excavato he
understood Caesar’s description in this sense, and tried in vain
to find the two trenches on the ' ht and the lest of the hill:
when he had found them in the p aces where they are marked
in the illustration, and his discovery had been accepted by
Napoleon as conclusive, commentatore tried to force Caesar-'s
words into agreement with Napoleon's Plan. ⁸ The key of tlns
description ⁹, said Dr. Rutherford (Gallio War, Hand III, Preface
and pp. 55-6). ‘ is pro castris, which proves that Caesar was
looking westward . . . along the axis of the hill.’ But Rutherford
himself supplied disproof; for in his Vocabulary (p. 124) he
rightly translated pm σαεινίε by ‘in frent of the camp': the
