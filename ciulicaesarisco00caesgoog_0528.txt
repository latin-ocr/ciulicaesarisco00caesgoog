Uxellodunum.—Hirtius says that Uxellodunum was in
the country of the Cadurci, which is represented b the depart-
ment of the Lot; that· the stronghold, which sto upon a hill,
{1230252‘333225032{zdssspl'gdsst‘zfflfflgfflhssfflffi
nearly surrounded the hill, there flowed a stream; that the
stream flowed at the very foot of the hill in such a way that it
was impossible to divert its course: that the descent to it for
the townspeople was difficult and steep; that 3,000 men got
out of the town, although it was blockaded by Caninius with
two legions, and sent back a sti-ing of pach-homes, loaded with
corn, into the peninsula: that below the stronghold, on that
part of the hill which, for a space of about 300 feet, was not
surrounded by the stream-in other words, on a part which
overlooked the isthmus—there was a s ring ; that opposite the

town 3 and that the Roman engineers drove subterranean gal-
leries towards the source of the sprin and diverted its ow

Of the various sites that have been reposed for identification
with Uxellodunum two only—Luzec (pronounced ‘ Luzesh ⁹)
and the Puy d‘Issolu—need be noticed here.

Luzech, which is about 7 miles west-northwest of Cahors, is
situated on an isthmus, at the foot and on the north of a hill
which rises 287 feet above the level of the Lot, and is nearly
surrounded by that river. The hill occupies 42 acres‚-not
more than one-third of the peninsula. No spring is to be
fotind, only a slight oozing, so to speak, of water above the
ist mus.

'l'he only oint which tells in favour of Luzech is that, alone
among all teis sites that have been pro osed, it is almost en·
tii-ely surrounded by a river, and that the readth of the isthmus
{5¹1² {2¹20}ssssssssssss ssffffissssffiesssszffl‘zssssieffss'zfiss ξοῗὲἷῗέῃῗι 332²}
the slopes are so gentle that even cai-nages can ascend without
difficult53 and the rocks of which the hill is com sed are so
hard that they cannot have suffered any considerab e change of
form. The Lot does not flow at the very foot of the hill; the
least distance which separates them is over 100, the greatest
500 yards. The oozing of water is not more than 13 or 14 feet
above the level of the isthmus. and the gigantic works which
the Romans constructed in order to place themselves on a level
with the sprin would therefore have been unnecessary. There
is a hill imme iately north of Luzech and considerably hi her,
on which are the remains of a Gallic fort, called Impe the
nearness of which makes it unlikely that Lusech was a strong·
hold at all. Lastly, if Uxellodunum was on a peninsula with an
isthmus only 300 feet wide, how could 3,000 men have got out
of it, how could a sti-ing of pach-homes have got into it again
when it was blockaded by two legions *Ρ They could not have
done so if the Roman general knew his business3 and his
