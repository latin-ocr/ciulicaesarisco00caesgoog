mounted upon the rear part of the, aqyer, before it reached its

each angle, which formed the principal part of e skeleton‚ so
to speak, of each tower3 and the tops of the uprights, which
projected above the highest story, were connected by planking
so as to form a new story. M. Jullian (H. G„ iii, 450) infers
from ξς 3-4 that the uprights of adjacent towers were connected
byplatforms (cf. viii, 9, §3-turrvsexcitari. . .pont‡‘bus traiectis

ξ 5. α vos cuniculos. What these cuniculi were is not
certain. rof. F. Frohlich believes that they were subterranean
galleries, by which Caesar intended to undermine the enemy's
wall; and this view is supported by a passage in Curtius (De
rebus yestis Alexandri Mayni, iv, 6, ξ 21): but if it is correct,

ciacconius, on the other hand, contrasting apenos cuniculos
with the tectos cuniculos, or ‘ covered galleries ', which were
driven into the rock at Uxellodunum, in order to divert a spring
(viii, 41, ξ 4), maintained that the former were open trenches3
and Ammianus Marcellinus (xxi, 12, ξ 6) describes besiegsrs as
attempting under the protection of mantlets to undermine awall:
but I can find no evidence that cuniculus ever meant an ο
trench, and the passages quoted in ThJ.L., iv. 1407-8, show t at
generally it meant an underground gallen· (G. G„ pp. 600-2).
