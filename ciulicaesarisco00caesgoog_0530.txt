434 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX

arrangements for disarming them Caesar moved on, and reached
Cenabum in two days‚—too late in the afternoon to begin the
siege, but not too late to begin the ‘needful reparations'
(vil, 10, ξ 4—11, ξ 5). One would infer that Ve launodunum
was about midway between Agedincum and Cenabum, but
perhaps rather nearer to the former than to the latter. There
was a Roman road, 67 miles long, from Agedincum to Cenabum,
which passed by ChateauLandon, Sceaux, and Beaune ; another,
mentioned in the Table of Peutinyer (F. 26, cols. 1-2), which

assed a little north of Gien, was 74 mi es; a third road, about
32 miles long, passed through Montargis and Ladon. We
cannot prove that an of these roads existed in the time of
Caesarg but it is hig ly probable that they all did.

worth considering,-Montarg1s an a site about a mile and
a half east of Sceaux. Roman anti uities have been found in
the neighbourhood of the former3 eltic remains and Roman
coins at the latter: both are a little nearer to Sens than to
Orleans. Sceaux‚ however, stands upon low-lyin marshy
ground3 and although Avaricum did the same, . Jullian
agrees with me in thinking that the site of Vellaunodunum is
probably Montargis (C. G„ pp. 494-8).

Venonii—The territory of this tribe corresponded with
Velay, or the department of the Loire-Su rieure (G. G„ g. 499)

Venelli—'Phe Venelli dwelt in the otentin,—the epart-
ment of the Manche (0. G„ p. 499).

Veneti.— Rou hly speaking, the Veneti occupied the depart-
ment of the Mor ihan. According to Ptolemy (Ganym, 1i, 8,
ἓξ 5-6), their territory extended northward as far as the Pointe

u Raz : if so, their northern frontier could not have coincided
with the northern frontier of the diocese of Vannes, which
struck the coast far south of that promontory. All that can
be safely said is that Venetia did not extend further northward
than the natural boundary formed by the Montagnes Noites
(0. G„ p. 499). See Osxsm.

Veram—This Alpine tribe lived in the western part of the
Valais‚ their chief town, Octodurus (iii, 1, 4), being situated
between Martigny-la·Ville and Martigny- ourg, on the lest
bank of the Rhone‚ near the point where it bends northward
towards the Lake of Geneva (0. G„ . 454).

Vesontio is now represented by esancon.

Vienna was on the site of Vienna, on the left bank of the
Rhone, about 20 miles south of Lyons.

ViromanduL—-The Viromandui, whose name survives in
Ver-mandois, inhabited the diocese of Noyon,—the northern
part of the department of the Aisne and the eastern part of
that of the Somme (0. G„ pp. 499-500).

vessima—Caesar says (iii, 23, ξ 1) that CrassuS, after he had
defeated the Sotiates, marched for the country of the Vocates
and the Tarusates. According to him, then, those two tribes
were conterminous. The Sotiates occupied the country round
