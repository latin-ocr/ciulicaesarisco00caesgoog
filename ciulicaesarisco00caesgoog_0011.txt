PREFACE v

The High Master of St. Paul's School‚ to whom
Ι 0111 grateful, has read nearly all my manuscript3
and, after considering his suggestione, I wrote some
additional 110100, struck out one or two, and modified
a few others ; but 110 10 1101 responsible for anything
which this book contains.

I have thought it right to confine myself 111 1110
110100 10 explaining Caesar’s text. Various historical
comments and other remarks which may be helpful,
but which would have been out of place in an edition
of the Commentarios, are to be found in Part I of my
Gaesao-'s Conquest of Gaul (second edition) and of
Ancie‘nt Britain.

Some readers may perhaps find opportunities of
exploring the scenes of Caesar's more important
operations ; for when one finds oneself, say, at Martigny
or upon the plateau of Alesia, the chapters in which
Caesar describes what happened there become more
vivid than even the best maps and plans can make
them. I have given on pages 447-8 directions as to
the best way of reaching the various places which
I have in mind.

It is now usual in English schools to read the
01000100 111 01111111010, partly, I suppose, in order that
boys may become acquainted with many authors
before they leave school. But by following this plan
they cannot become intimate with any. One may
read Macaulay’s essay 011 Clive with profit even if
one i’gnores all the others3 but to read the 11111111
chapter only of his H‘Lstmy of Enylamd would not
be wise. Moreover, there is no reason, apart from the
consideration of what subjecta are most remunerative,
why Caesar should only be used as an elementary
text-book. It cannot be read with the maximum of
profit by a young boy, and it ought to be read rapidly
through, at least once, by the highest form in the
school. In saying this I have the support of the
late High Master of St. Paul’s, who told me that
