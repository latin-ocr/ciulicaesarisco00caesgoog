12-14. Oddly enough Meusel does not bracket these cha ters
in his latest edition (1908), though both he (J. Β., 1910, pp. 2 -31
and Klotz (C.S., pp. 43-50) give reasons for doin so. Mense
points out that neither Pliny (Nat. Hist„ iv, 16, ξ 1 ) nor Tacitus
(Agricola, 10) mentions Caesar among the writers whom they
quote in their descriptione of Britain3 and he objects, further,
that Belyium (12, ξ 2) means the whole territory of the Belgae,
whereas in the passages (24, ξ 2; 25, 4) in which the word is
used by Caesar it means only a part o their territory, and that
in 14, ξ 1 his is meaningless. This last remark seems to me
hypercritical; and does not Caesar use the words Gallia and
Galli both in a general and in a restricted sense ⁶? Klotz

and t t several expressions in the three chapters could not
have been used b Caesar. Undoubtedly the description inter·
rupts the story3 ut so does the digression on the manners and
customs of the Gauls and Germans (vi, 11-24), the authenticity
of which is indis utable. Linguistic arguments in inquiries of
this sort should used with cantion, and some of Klotz’s con·
clusions seem to me questionable (0. Β., 1912, p. 92), though it
must be admitted that if any one of them is certain, he has

roved his case. He concludes that the ‘ Pseudo-Caesar' used

‘magenes as an authorit ‚ and that for much of the deseri tion
the original source was osidonius. But there is no evi enee
that Posidonius was ever in Britain (A.B., p. 499, n. 2); and
the mention of iron ‘currency·bars' (taleis ferreis [12, ξ 4])
and of water-clocks (13, ξ 4) must have come from an eye-
witness. If he was not Caesar, the interpolator, when he wrote
Nos nihil . . . videbamus, was also a liar. Still, 1 bracket the
chapters, because if Meusel and Klotz have not proved that
they are spurious, they have 'ven sufficient reasons for suspect-
