their successors domesticated cattle and ultimately learned
to till the soil. Among them were some whose chiefs
erected dolmenS, or vast structures of stone, to cover the
sepulchres of their dead. Some are of enormous size,
and could only have been erected by the toil of multi·
tudes, controlled and organized by chiefs whose motive
was to propitiato the spirits that they believed to survive.
At Perotte, in the department of the Charente‚ a stone
was set up which weighed forty tons and had been
quarried twenty miles away: the tumulus of Mont
St. Michel in the Morbihan is a veritable hill, and con-
tains more than forty thousand cubic yards of stone.
The era in which these monuments were constructed
was marked by considerable commercial activity; for
some of them have yielded ornaments of a mineral re-
sembling turquoise, which must have been imported3
amber beads had already been conveyed from the Baltic
by way of the Elbe‚ the Moldau, and the Danube3 and
flint from the factory of the Grand-Pressigny in the
Indre·et·Loire was diffused as far as Switzerland.

Slowly, insensibly, civilization moved onward. There
is evidence to show that the Neolithic Age set in nearly
ten millenniums before our era; the Bronze Age, which
succeeded it, began about 2000 Β. o. 3 and it was not until
more than a thousand years had passed that the culture
which derives its name from the Tyrolese settlement
of Hallstatt, and in which bronze, as material for tools
and weapons‚ gradually gave place to iron, spread west·
ward across the Rhine. The knowledge of metals pene-
trated into Gaul by two routeS, of which the starting·
point was in the Aegean. south-Baetem Gaul was served
by a route that led through Central Europe; Western
Gaul horrowed from Spain. Although the memory of
inter-tribal war is preserved by earthworks and stone
forts which, even in the Neolithic Age, had been erected
upon the hills, commerce‚ internal and external, advanced
with rapid strides. Forests were gradually cleared ; and
trackways were laid out from village to village. Caravans
began to cross the Alps from the valley of the Po. Gold
