se quod in longiorem diem conlaturus fuisset reprae-
sentaturum et proxima nocte de quarta vigilia castra
moturum, ut quam primum intellegere posset utrum

Quod si praeterea nemo sequatur, tamen se cum sola 15

decima legione iturum, de qua non dubitet, sibique
eam praetoriam cohortem futuram. Huic legioni

Caesar et indulserat praecipue et propter virtutem

The rst general who formed a praetorian cohort was Scip1o
Aemilianus in the sie e of Numantia (133 Β.ο.).

turione of the first rank ' ⁴? No less than eight theories have been
devised about them; but it is,lbelieve,now enerally admitted
that they were the six centurione of the st cohort in each
legion. For the ten cohorte in each legion were numbered3
the lst ranked above the rest (v, 15, ξ 4) ; and it may therefore
be presumed that all took rank according to their numberS.
That this was the case under the Empire is certain3 for the
loth cohort was the lowest. Moreover, a centurion was pro-
moted in the civil war ‘from the &th class to the rank of
primipilus ’, or chief centurion of the legi0n; and Modestus,
a centurion who had served for eighteen years in four grades
of rank, held the position of hastatus posterior in the 3rd cohort,
