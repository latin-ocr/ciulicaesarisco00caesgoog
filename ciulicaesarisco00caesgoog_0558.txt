462 CORRIGEN DA AND ADDENDA

vi, 4, 5 8. Schneider says that instantis belli depends ,not upon esse, but
upon tempus understood ; but may one not compare non huius
temporis ista oratio eat?

13, 5 1. omni Gallia perhaps includes the country of the Belgae, although

in ii, 1, 52 it means the country of the Celtae only. See
the note on 5 11.

vii, 15, 54. prou, though it usually precedes the adjective which it
qualifim, belongs to pulcherrimam.

*77, 5 6. My foot-note on this sentence ie somewhat misleading; for
dignitas here means ‘authority' or ‘distinction’ in the
abstract, and tantum apud me dioniius potest may be translated
by ‘so highly do 1 respect authority ’, though of course
Critognatus had in mind the authority of those who
advocated the view which he had opposed.
