ξ 3. esse-nt is a correction, made by ciacconius for esset: it recom- ”pened-

R. enge's conjecture. The reading of ιι is milium passuum XV
in circuitu munitionem3 of β, X milium in circuitu munitionem
pediun X V(where pedum XV would denote the breadth of the
ditch). It would of course have been absurd to surround
Cicero's small camp, the perimeter of which could not have
been much more than a mile (G. G„ p. 251), with a contravalla-
tion of 15 or even of 10 Roman miles. Na leon ΙΙΙ and others

testudines were sappers’ huts, used for protecting soldiers
when they were filling up ditches, undermining walls, διο.
They had sloping roofs, so that stenes dropped on to them
by the enemy might slide off harmiessly‚ and they were pro-
tected ' st fire, probably by raw hides soaked in water.
Minute escriptions of these huts, derived from various writers,
Greek and Roman, are to be found in dictionaries of antiquities;
but 1 do not advise the reader to consult them; for it is not
likely that the testudines which the Nervii made resembled
those of the Greeks, though they may have been constructed
on the same general principles. A testudo, used by Caesar-’s
