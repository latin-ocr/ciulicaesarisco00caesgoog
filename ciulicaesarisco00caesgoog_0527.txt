SUESSIONES—TURONI 431

Tergestini.—The Tergestini were the inhabitants of Ter-
geste, a town which is represented by the modern Trieste.

TIGOR(inorum) has been found near Avenches, south of the
lake of Morat3 and accord’ ly the “ utini are su posed to v

Tolosa stood ugon the site of Toulouse.

Tolosatem—The Tolosates possessed that part of the terri-
tory of the Volcae Tectosages which corresponded with the
ancient diocese of Toulouse ( olom), that is to sa , the greater
part of the department of the Haute-Vienne an a part of the
department of the G'ers (C. G„ p. 480).

Treveri.—ansar says that the territory of the Treveri,
whose name is reco izable in Treves, extended to the Rhine
(iii, 11,§ 1; vi, 9, 5); that it was conterminous with the
territory of the Remi (v, 24, ξ 2); and that it was se ated
from the Eburones by the Segni and Condrusi (vi, 32, §pff It
cannot be defined exactly, because we do not know whether the
Treveri or the Mediomatrici, who were their southern neigh-
bours, possessed the territory which afterwards belonged to the
Vangiones, and because we cannot trace the frontiers of the
Eburones, Se ', and Condrusi, with which no dioceses

Vinxtbach, be ween the Ahr and the oselle; and their
territory comprised the greater part of the province of Luxem-
bourg, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the southern part
of Rhenish Prussia (0. G„ p. 481).

Triboci—The Triboci were one of the tribes that fought in
the host of Ariovistus (i, 51, ξ 2) which had for some time
been settled in the northern part off* the country of the Sequani
(31, 10), that is to sa , in the lain of Alsace. Caesar says
(38, 1) that the who e host ofp Ariovistus took part in the
campaign, and (53, ξ 1-3) that after his defeat the very small
remnant of his host t at escaped destruction was driven across
the Rhine. According to Strabo, however (iv, 3, ξ 4), the
Triboci had taken up their abode in the count of the
Mediomatrici. If the ancestors of these Triboci h invaded
Gaul under Ariovistus, then, Caesar’s statement notwithstanding,
those who fought in the army of Ariovistus were only a portion
of the tribe. Anyhow it is obviously impossible to determine
the frontiers of the Triboci as they existed in the time of
Caesar (0. G„ pp. 481-2).

'trinovantes—This tribe inhabited Eam, for their chief
town, Camulodunum (Ptolemy, Geoyr„ ii, 3, ξ 11), was on the
site of Colchester.

Tulingi. See LA'rosmol.

Turoni—The territory of the Turoni corresponded with the
diocese of Tours, or, rou hly speaking, the department of the
lndre·et-Loire (0. G„ p. 4888).
