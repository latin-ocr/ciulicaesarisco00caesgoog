island ’ (quac cum adprqomquarm Britanniae et m: castris
viderentur, tanta tempestae subito οοονία est ut nulla carum
cumn· tenere posset, sed aliae codem unde erant profectae
referrentur, aliae ad Μία-101918 partem insulae, quae eet pro-
pius eolis occasum, maqno suo cum periculo deicerentur). The
camp, as I have shown in Ancient Britain, was at Walmer.
This conclusion has been generally accepted; 81111 Μ1.
Wightman does not gainsay it„ Indeed unless the camp
was aomewhere in East Kent, no lee shore can by any
ingenuity be discovered ; and supposing that when the
storm arose the transporta were a little south of Walmer
-say somewhere near the point where the South Sand
Head Light Vessel is now moored—-they were obviously
in no danger of being driven ashore by a 11οῶ-98919111
38191 they would have been driven through the Dover
811811 into the Ghannel. If Mr. Wightman does not know
the British coast, let him consult a map, and he will 999
11181 the only 199 911019 10 which he can point is the shore
of East Kent. But this is 0111 of the question, not only
for the reason which I 11819 just given, but also for
others t—first, the ships had been making for East Kent,
but when the storm arose they could not keep their
course; secondly, the ships with which we are concerned
were swep t down towards‘ the lower and more 119919111
11811 of the island’. When they were running in what
was, 89 Μ1. Wightman himself says, a ‘south· ·westerly
direction' and before what 119 rightly calls‘ 8 1101111·
easter’, ¹ they were evidently in no danger of striking
either the British coast 01 1119 Gallie 90891, ·² 81111 the
nearest 199 911019 1189 the shore of Central Amol-ica, or,
possibly, one of the Bermudas! Mr. Wightman 11191919
11181 ‘deici applied to ships refers, not 10 their scudding
before 8 3819 111111 plenty of sea-room . . . but to their
being swept down upon some danger point 10 199118111 ’.
It may refer 10 either: anyhow in this 9899 1119 ‘ danger
point’ was 3,000 miles or more away.

‘Yet '‚ continues Mr. Wightman, ‘aside from 811 11119,
Μ1. Ηο111199’9 theory breaks down on internal evidence.
If two methods of procedure were open 10 1119 Gallie
sailors—either to run before the wind or lie to-why, I
ask, after pursuing the former method for 8 time, did
they subsequently anchor ’ἓ ’ Evidently, I reply, because

¹ A wind blowing from the north-east off Walmer or Kingsdown
would be diverted a point or two southward oss‘ the south coast.

² Caesar' 9 words-ad 'vedommu ‚deicerentur—show that the course
of the ships was roughly parallel with the British coast, not diago nal
in the directi 1011 of Cape La Η83119.Μο190191,Ι need hardly say
that the skippers had 110111191111011 of running 170 miles.
