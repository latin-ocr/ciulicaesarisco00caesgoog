xxxvi HOW SOME OF CAESAR’S CAMPS

been thrown in did not pack closely3 but in course of
time and owing to yearly cultivation, the ground settled
down to the level of the surrounding land ; and thus
all apparent traces of Caesar’s camps have disappeared.
The earth with which the ditches are filled is loose and
never recovers the consistency of virgin soil, so that even
now, after the lapse of 2,000 years, it easily breaks
under the blows of the pick. This is what enables one to
discover the ditches, when one knows how to determine
the probable position of a camp. That, as you very truly
say, is the essential condition. First of all, then, one
must study the country where one supposes the camp to

 

have been situated3 and to do this requires a thorough
knowledge of ansar's Commentaries and also special
military knowledge.' Ι may remark that the camp would
be constructed, if possible, on an easily accessible and
yet defensible position, that is, on gently sloping ground:
it would have to be near pasturage for the horses, running
water, and timber, which was needed both for fortification
and for firewood. '

‘ The following ', continues Colonel Stoffel, ‘is the
method which I have always adopted in order to discover
the ditches of a camp. Let A Β c n repreoent an area
within which Ι believed that the camp of which 1 was in
search was to be found ; and let us assume that the layer
of productive soil is 70 centimetres [about 2 feet 3} inches]
