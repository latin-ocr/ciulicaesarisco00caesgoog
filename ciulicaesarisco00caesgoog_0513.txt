the same, and the suvii were not a maritime people‚ though
Caesar (ii, 34) says that they were. It seems more probable
11181, they also possessed the territories of the Baiocasses and the
Viducasses, and that, just as the Helvetii were divided into four

Genava was, I need hardly say, the Gallie name of Genera.

Gergovia was long ago identified with a mountain which
rises fully 1,200 feet above the plain, about 4 miles south of
clermont-Ferrand. It is the only mountain in Auvergne—
the country of the Arverni—which corresponds with Caesar's
narrative (vii, 35; 36, §§ 1-2, 5; 44-6).

Gorgobina was the stronghold, or the chief stronghold, of
the Boi (vii, 9, ff 6). Caesar sa s (1, 28, ξ 5) 11181 after 118 had
defeated the He vetii he allowe the Boi, at the request of the
Aedui, to settle in Aeduan territory; and he adds that the
Aedui made this request because they knew that the Boi were
brave. One might be inclined to infer that the Boi were estab-
lished in the western part of the Aeduan territory, where they
would serve as an outpost against those old rivals of the Aedui,
the Arverni. Indeed‚ unless their settlement was in that neigh-
bourhood, Caesar’s account (vii, 11, ξ 9; 12-13) of his march
from Cenabum (01188118) to Noviodunum and thence to Avaricum
(Bourges), taken in conjunction with his statement that Verein-
getorix, marching from the country of the Arverni to Gorgobina,

foi-ward the supply,—that is, somewhere in the western part of
the Aeduan territory. M. Jullian, however, thinks that they
were intended to serve as an outpost, not against the Arverni
but against the Bituriges, and accordin ly he believes that,
besides the country between the Allier an the Loire, they also
possessed a strip of land between the Aedui and the Bituri s,
south of that part of the Loire which separated those two tri s
(5, ξ 4), 11181 18, 8011111 of the confluence of the Allier and the
Loire (see Eanum). 1 cannot 888 what reason the Aedui had
for establishing an outpost against the Bituriges, who were in
a state of fn'endly dependence upon them (5, ξ 2).
