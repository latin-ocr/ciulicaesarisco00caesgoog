COMMENTARIUS III 117

Eburovices Lexoviique, senatu suo interfecto quod
auctores belli esse nolebant, portas clauserunt seque
cum Viridovice coniunxerunt ; magnaque praeterea 4
multitudo undique ex Gallia perditorum hominum
5 latronumque convenerat, quos spes praedandi studium-
que bellandi ab agri cultura et cotidiano labore
revocabat. Sabinus idoneo omnibus rebus loco castris 5
sese tenebat, cum Viridovix contra eum duorum milium
spatio consedisset cotidieque productis copiis pugnandi
10 potestatem faceret, ut iam non solum hostibus in
contemptionem Sabinus veniret, sed etiam nostrorum
militum vocibus non nihil carperetur3 tantamque 6
opinionem timoris praebuit ut iam ad vallum castro-
rum hostes accedere auderent. Id ea de causa faciebat 7

of ξ 4, whereas the latter is expressly said to have formed an
addition. J. Lange, however (N. J., cxlvii, 1893, p. 359), re-
marking that Caesar nowhere else uses the expression exercitum
coyere, conjectures that he wrote equitatum maynaeque copias.

ξ 3. auctores. Remember that auctor does not always mean
‘author’ or ‘originator', but is sometimes equivalent ιο qui
probat aliquid.

§4 revocabat. Meusel‚ following W. Paul, inserts et before
quos, and, adopting an emendation of his own, substitutes
sevocabat for the MS. reading, revocabat. Klotz (C.S., p. 247-9)
condemns the former alteration on the ground that e perditi
homines were influenced by spes praedandi and the latrones
by studium bellandi; the latter because he regards the word
revocabat as more applicable than sevocabat to casua] labourers
like these ‘ de radoes and brigands ’. Klotz's arguments seem
to me weak. he first is due ιο that restless spirit, characteristic
of certain German scholare, which insiste that Caesar must
always have written symmetrically: the second depende upon
the assumption that the desperadoes and brigands did occa-
sionally work, whereas Caesar ma mean that ‘the hope of
plunder and love of fighting were constantly] more atti-active
[ιο them] than farming and regular work ’. Still, if he does
mean this, ec is su erfluous. As for revocabat, Ι suppose that
Meu-el rejects it ecause in every other assage m which
Caesar uses the word it means either ‘to reca l' or ⁴ to withdraw
from ' 3 but may it not also mean to divert from the thought of
doing what has not yet been done *Ρ

ᾗ 5. Sabinus . . . tenebat. lt is impossible to fix the site of
this camp3 for Caesar tells us nothing about it, except that it
was in the country of the Venelli (see p. 434), and on high und
which sloped gently down for the distance of about one man
mile to the plain. M. Jullian may, however, be ri ht in
selectin Vire, a place where several roads meet, about 3 miles
east of ranville (C. G„ p. 688).
