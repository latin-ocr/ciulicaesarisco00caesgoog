COMMENTARIUS II 73

Iccius Remus, summa nobilitate et gratia inter suos, ἵ

though, if it di ,giebat would have to be altered into sactum est’.
But might not Quod . . . fiebat mean ‘in this case the operation
was being easily performed ’ ⁶? Schneider defends the order of
the words Gallorum . . . Belqarum, arguing that Caesar wished
to em hasize the fact that the mode of attack which he de·
seri was common to all the Gallie tribes; but it must, 1
think, be admitted that the passage, as it stands, is unsatisfac-
tory. If we adopt the conjecture succedunt, which is probable
enough, we are eonfronted with the difficulty that Caesar no-
where else uses succedo, governing an accusative, without a
prepositiion. Accordingly Klotz (G. S„ pp. 243—4) substitutes
’us or as.
4. numm. Mense] (J. B., 1894, p. 250), following the
Al ine edition, reads nuntios, because in 7, ξ 1 Caesar writes
isdem ducibus usus qm· nuntii ab Iccio venerant. But what if
nuntium means, as it often does, ‘ a message ' *Ρ Schneider says
that it cannot, for ‘ Caesar only says nuntium and nuntios mittere
and dt'mittere of men, whereas of things he says [nuntium]
accipere, afferre, and perferre ⁹. This is a weak argument. Caesar,
nowhere else has occasion to speak of sending] a message, and
he only uses accipere, adfeffe, and perferre in this connexion
twelve times in all. Cicero (Ata, i, 13, ξ 3) writes uxori Caesarem
nuntium remisisse.
¹7, ᾗ 1. de media nocte is generally ex lained as meaning ⁴ in
the middle of the night ’ or ‘ about mi night ’ (Th. l. L„ v, 64,
with which cf. CI. Ph„ 1913, pp. 7-13), though Caesar sometimes
writes media nocte without de. Ι am not quite sure that de does
not mean ‘just after ' (midnight); sor Censorinus (24, § 2) says
tempu-equod huic [mediae nocti] proximum est vocatur de media
nocte. Cf. the third note on i, 12, ξ 2.
