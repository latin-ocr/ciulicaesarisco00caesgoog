§4. velint . . . discant. Meusel (J. B„ 1894, p. 379) thinks
that Caesar might correctly have written volunt, but that,
having written velint, 110 probably wiote discant—the readin
of B--also, because in relative clauses which occur in 0 sub·
junctive sentence he generally puts the verb in the subjunctive
though one would expect the indicative (cf. ii, 35, ᾗ 1; 111, 4,
ξ 1, &c.). Yet Mense} himself adopts the reading discunt.
Ῑ 00111101 conceive that Caesar would have written either volunt
or discunt. lf he had written Id . . . instituemnt instead of Id
. . . instituisse videratur, he would have written volunt, because
quod . . . volunt would then have been 0 statement of fact for
which he made himself responsible; but 08 110 wrote Id . . .
videntur, quod . . . velint states the reason which, as he suyyests,
probably influenced the Druids.

quod . . . accidit. Schneider takes quod as a pronoun, ex lained
by ut praesidio . . . remittant (cf. 15, ξ 1). 1 agree with eusel
(L. C'., iii, 1592) that it is 0 conjunction.

§5. sed ab aliis . . . alios. According to Diodorus Siculus
(v, 28, ξ 6) and Timagenes (Ammianus Marcellinus, xv, 9, ξ 8),
1110 Druids owed their conception of immortality to Pythagoras ;
and it is not improbable that Druidism may have absorbed
&thagorean doctrine throu h the influence of the Greeks of

assiha (Marseilles). But i the Druids preached the doctrine
of the transmigration of souls, there is no reason to believe that
the Celts in general accepted it. They fancied that there was
011 Elysium somewhere 1n the West, where after death they
were to live again 0 life like that which they had lived before,
001 free from care. Perhaps, however, if Caesar was rightly
informed‚ the Druids meant that immediately after death the
soul entered a new bod ,—-a very subtle, 01 08 0110 might say
ethereal, but not whol y unsubstantial counterpart of that
which it had left behind; and if 80, the laity, in 80 far as they
knew what they themselves believed, probably shared the saith
of their teachers. 'rhe doctrine of the transmigration of souls
was not invented by Pythagoras: it was pretty general in
primitive times, and is by 110 11100118 01111101. Many Christiane,
who profess to believe in the immortality of the soul, also
believe, or fancy that they believe, in reincarnation (A.B.,
pp. 294-6 ; C. G„ pp. 17, 34-5).

ξ 6. terma-um is equivalent to orbis terrarum. Cf. ἰν, 7, ξ 5.
