HOW SOME OF CAESAR'S CAMPS AN D
OTHER EARTHWORKS HAVE
BEEN DISOOVERED

'1¹11ss late Colonel Stoffel contributed much to our
knowledge of the history of the Gallie war by excava-
tions, which he carried out on behalf of Napoleon 111.
In 1899 he described to me his method in a letter which

other well-known investigators. , Δ

The colonel begins by remarking that land on which
an entrenched camp can be constructed always has an
upper layer of productive soil (terre υέρέιαῖε), varying
from one or two to five feet thick, below which lies the
subsoil (sous-sol or sol vierye)‚-marl, limestone, or other,
according to the locality. ‘When,’ he continues, ‘ after

into the ditch (fo-386). The ditch was thus filled with
mixed soil, composed partly of productive soil, partly of
