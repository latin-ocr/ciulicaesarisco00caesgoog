Belgio tribes were 400 miles from the Veneti; but they com-
gxanded the coast from which Caesar would have to embark for

rebellio does not here mean ‘ rebellion '. Think of the derivation.

ξ 3. libertati studere is the reading of a τ β has libertatis studiose
incitari, which is nonsense, but has led Klotz G. 8., pp. 246-7) to
offer avery ingenious emendation. He remar s that in libertatis
studim we may discern an older reading, libertatis studio,

breadth of Gaul ; but, as they made an alliance wit the Morini
and Menapii and sent for reinforcements from Britain, it is not
impossible. Ι am not convinced. 'I'he interests of the Morini,
the Menapii, and the Britons coincided with those of the
