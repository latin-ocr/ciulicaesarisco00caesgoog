Caesar writes pro castris, he means ‘on the side of the camp
which faced the enemy ’. Rutherford’s ‘key’ only opened the
door to fresh mistakes. Having mistranslated pro castris, he
was obliged to mistranslate in fronte, which, he said, ‘ refers to
that end of the hill's ridge furthest removed from the camp’3
whereas any one who looks at the illustration will see that the
⁸ front ’ of the hill can only be that side of it which faced the
‘3123 ’ῗέῑι ωλᾩᾚὲῗῧὲἓὲΐὲἒῗηζῗῗῗ θ”ἒέιῗίθ“ἓιῖἓ’ᾶιέἒέξέ filim&
battle to be formed along it; whereas, according to his inter-
pretation of Caesar and according to Napoleon's Plan, the hill
was wide enough to allow the line of battle to be formed upon
it alonyside os the camp: that is to say, wider, by the length
of one side of the camp, than Caesar says. It is clear that,
according to Caesar, the line of battle was formed in front of,
not alongside of, the camp. Finally, Caesar says that his object
in constructing the two trenches was to prevent the enemy
from attackin his troops on their flanks (ab lateribus). Would
he have used t e plural if he had only meant the right flank ⁴?

The camp at Manchamp is open to two other objections. The
western slope of the hill is so extremely gentle that it could not
rightly be described by the words lateris deiectus (§ 3); for
deiectus denotes a sharp, fairly steep gradient. Ruthersord.
indeed, perversely identifies the lateris deiectus with the northern
and southern sides of the hi11; but the northern and southern
slopes are hardly less gentle than the others. Also the trench
which, according to Napoleon's Plan, touched the Aisne is onl
400 metres long, whereas, according to Caesar, each trenc
measured about 400 passus, or nearly 592 metres; and it shows
no trace of a redoubt. Napoleon strove to meet this objection
by asserting that the Aisne had changed its course since 57 B. c,
and thereby obliterated all traces of the end of the trench and
of the redoubt. But there is no evidence that the course of the
Aisne has changed.

Now sor Pontavert. If Caesar crossed the Aisne there, the
hill on which he encamped must have been the plateau of
Chaudardes‚.which is shown in my plan. When 1 examined
this ground 1 noted one or two objections. 'l'he western end of

· the plateau, where the flank companies of Caesar's left wing

would have been posted, does not ‘ gradually merge in the plain
by a gentle slope’ in fronte leniter fastiyatus paulatim ad
planitiem redibat [ξ 3 >- but is actually rather lower than the
ground immediately in front of it which would have been
occupied by the Belgae; while the northward slope of the
conti-231 and eastern parts of the plateau is perhaps rather too
mar .

On the whole, the topography of Manchamp‚ with the very
important exception of (lateris) deiectus, conforme perhaps
somewhat more closely to Caesar's description; but the results

a flank
attach.
