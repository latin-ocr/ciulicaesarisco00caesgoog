as I have s own in G.R., 1912, p. 92, has gone very near to
proving that the author of Bell. Alex. was Hirtius.

ξ 8. cum interim . . . coicere. The construction of this sentence
is rather involved. Aa deditionem depends u n invitantibus as
well as upon adduci3 and nulla calamitate elongs to adduci
as well as to victus,

adduci. Adduco is never used with an infinitiva in good Latin

the topography of the campaign is to be found in 9, ξξ 1-4;
10, § 23 11, ξ 1; 14, ξς 4-5; 16‚§ 3; 18, ξ 1; und20, ξ 1. The
gist of it is this. The Gauls encamped on a hill, standin in
a wooded country and protected by a morass (9, ξ 1; 10, 2;
11, § 13 12, ξ 1). The morass was at the bottom of a deep and
narrow valley, separating the hill from another, on which Caesar
pitched his camp (9, § 23 10, 2) ; and the position ‘oi' the Gauls
was so strong that it would ave been impossible to storin it
without heavy loss 11, ξ 1). Caesar’s camp had two ditches
with vertical sides 9, ξ 3). The hill upon which the Gauls
were encamped was separated by a small valley from a hill—
not the one on which Caesar encamped— the summit of which
formed a plateau and the sides of which were steep; and this
hill was large enough to admit of four legions being drawn up
on it in line of battle (14, §§ 4-5). Caesar reached it by bridging
the moraes (14, ξ 4). About 10 Roman miles from the camp of
the Gauls was a very strong place, upon which they encamped
after they had been driven from their former position (16, 3).
Near this second encampment was a meadow, not more t n
one Roman square mile in extent, which was surrounded partly
by woods, part-ly by a very deep river (18, ξ 1), or, if we adopt
the readin of a—-impeditissimo flumine-a river very difficult
to cross. ff'his meadow was said to be not more than 8 Roman
miles from the second camp of the Bellovaci (20, ξ 1).

The only site that corresponds perfectly with Hirtius's
description of the original sition of the Gauls is Mont
St. Marc, on the east of the ise and about 3 miles south of
