the German contemporaries of Caesar. My own ο inion is that
we can never disprove Caesar-‘s report of the G ic tradition
that the Druidical doctrine originated in Britain, and, in the 1
absence of other testimony, had better cling to it.
Sir John Rhys (Celtic Britain, 3rd ed„ 1904. PP. 57, 61) ¹
maintains that there is no evidence that Druidism was ever
the religion of any Brythonic people,-—·that is ιο sa , of

almost the whole of Britain south of the firths of Forth and
Clyde ιο the Brythons‚ he appears to restrict the British area
of Druidism to a narrow western fringe. This hardly rees
with Caesa-r's statement that Britain was the strongho d of l
Druidism. Moreover, Caesar plainly gives us ιο understand ;
that Druidism was common to all the peoples whom he calls
Celtae (i, 1, δ l),—the peoples between the Seine and the
Garonne3 and it is certain that among them the Brythonic l
element was predominant (see p. xlvii). Indeed‚ althou h it is
commonly assumed that the Belgae had no Druids, ere is
absolutely no ground for the assumption. Caesar often used
the word Galli in a broad sense, including the Belgae3 and it
is not improbable that when he was describing the manners
and customs of the Gauls, and Druidism, which was their most
remarkable institution, he intended his description to apply to
the Belgae. Sir John Rhys acce ts the political part of the
description as applying ιο fh? Befgic and the other Brythonic
tribes of both Gaul an Britain. et he insists that that part
of the same description which deals with Druidism, and which
is closely connected with the political part, has nothing to do
with either the Belgae or the other Brythons (C. G„ pp. 523-Ξέ
14, § 1. neque tribu—ea . . . pendunt. M. Jullian (H. G„ ii, )
infers from una that the Druids did pay taxes, but separately
and at a lower rate than the laity. Perhaps they voluntarily
contributed to the revenue. cf. Schneider's Caesar, ii, 280.

these words as a superfluous gloss upon the receding sentence.

it is necessarily equivalent, as Herzog supposes, to neyote'u's.
