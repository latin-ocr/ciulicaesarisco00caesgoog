to the republic, make it his business to protect the Aedui
and the other allies of the Roman people.¹ Meanwhile
the Sequani had found that their ally was their master.
He was not going to return to the wilds of Cermany
when he could get a rich territory for the asking. He
compelled the Sequani to cede to him the fertile plain of
Alsace. At length they and their Gallic allies, including,
as it should seem, even the Aedui, mustered all their
forces and made a desperate effort to throw off the yoke:
but they sustained a crushing defeat3 and their con-
queror was evidently determined to found a German
kingdom in Gaul.

Meanwhile the AllobrogeS, who had never yet fairly
accepted their dependent condition, had risen in revolt.
They were still embittered by defeat when the Roman
agents in the Province were alarmed by the appearance of
bands of marauders on the right bank of the Rhone.
They had been sent by the Helvetii, a warlike Celtic
people‚ who dwelt in that part of Switzerland which lies
between the Rhine, the J ura, the Lake of Geneva„ and the
Upper Rhone. The Romans had already felt the weight
of their arms. A generation before, the Tigurini, one of
the four Helvetian tribes, had thrown in their lot with
the Cimbri. They had spread desolation along the valley
of the Rhene, defeated a consular army, and compelled
the survivors to pass under the yoke. Now, in their
turn, they were hard pressed by the Germans; they had
reason to fear that the victorious host of Ariovistus
would sever them from their Celtic kinemen; and they
had formed the resolution of abandoning their country
and seeking a new home in the fertile land of Gaul.

The author of the movement was Orgetorix, the head
of the Helvetian baronage. His story throws a vivid
light upon the condition of the Gallie tribes. He per-
suaded his brother nobles that they would be able to win
the mastery over Gaul, and undertook a diplomatic mis-
sion to the leading Transalpina states. Two chiefs were

was aimed against Ariovistus; for there is no evidence that the
Helvetii entered Gaul before 60 tac.
