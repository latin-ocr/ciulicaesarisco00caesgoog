LEMOVICES-MENAPII 423

Strabo (iv, 3, 5), Ptolemy (Gema, ii, 8, ξ 11 ‚ and other
writers, certain y occupied the diocese of Mean, t atis to say,
the northern part of the department of the Seineet-Marne and
a fraction of the south-eastern t of the department of the
Oise; but some commentators eny that Gaesar's Meldi were
*⁴¹³9 same. For Caesar says Ἓξ, 5, ξ 2) that on arrivin at Portus
Itius‚where he had ordered is fleet to assemble‚ he ound that
60 ships, which had been built in the country of the Meldi,
had been prevented by contrary winds from reaching the
harbour, and had returned to the lace from which they had
started. Portus Itius was either issant or, much more pro-
bably, Boulogne. The troops who built the fleet had wintered
in the country of the Belgae (iv, 38, §43 v, 1, 1): there-
fore all the ships had been built on or east o the Seine;
and Strabo (iv, 3, ξ 3) says that Gaesar’s naval arsenal was at
the mouth of that river. It has been argued, first, that as the
wind prevented those ships which had been built in the country
of the Meldi, but not the others, from reaching Portus Itius,
and as the bulk of the fleet must have been constructed in or
south of that harbour, we must look for the Meldi to the
north of it; secondly, that Caesar would not have built ships
so far from the sea as Meau13 and thirdly, that even ir he
had done so, the 60 ships would not have sailed back up the
Seine and the Marne. Accordingly it has been suggested
that Gaesar's Meldi inhabited the country round Maldeghem,
about 10 miles east of B es! But the 60 ships ma have
sailed from the same side o Portus Itius as the rest, or the
wind which stopped them may not have arinen until after the
others had reached port3 it 1s certain that in the eighteenth
century timber used for constmctingbmges at Rouen came from
the neighbourhood of Meau13 and ”aesar does not say that the
60 ships returned to the country of the Meldi, but onl that
the returned to the place from which they had ‘ ed,—
pro bly the mouth of the Seine, where they may have re·
mained for a time after they had dropped down the river from
Meaux. 'I'he word Maldeyhem has no connexion with Meldi, but
is derived from the Dutch plant-name, melda and it is absurd
to su pose that Caesar would have established a ‹lockyard on
the orth Sea, near Bruges (Ο. G.. pp. 447-9).

Menapii—The Menapii possessed land on the right bank of
the Rhine‚ not far from the sea, as well as on the left (iv, 1,
ξ 1; 4, {fh ‘ the island of the Batavi '‚ which is mentioned by
the wri r of iv, 10, may have belonged to·them as well,·for

was bounded on the south by that of the Eburones (vr, 5, ξ 4)
and on the west b that of the Morini (Strabo, iv, 3, ς Pliny,
Nat. Hist„ iv, 17, ξ 106 . The land which belonged them on
the right bank of the hine was in the neighbourhood of Gleve
and Xanten (see the note on iv, 1, ᾗ 1 [non lorgqe a Μανῆ). So
much is certain; but to trace the rontier which se arated the
Menapii from the Morini is difficult, if not impossib e.

According to Ptolemy (amyra, ii, 9, §§ 4-5), the eastern limit
of the Morini was the Tabula. This nver, which 1s not men·
tioned by any other writer, is generally supposed to have been
