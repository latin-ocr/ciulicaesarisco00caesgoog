But before he attacked the Germane they must have moved
away from that country; for it is generally admitted that they
fled either towards the Waal or to the confluence of the Moselle
and the ahino, and in either case their destruction would have
taken place at a considerable distance from the territories of
the Eburones and Condrusi. When the German envoys proposed
to send a message to the Ubii (11, §§ 2-3) they were not more
than 12 miles from the German camp, which Caesar attacked on
the following day. If, then, the Germane fied to the Waal, the

hand, the defeat took place near the confluence of the Moselle
and the Rhine, they would only have had to travel the few
miles that separated them from the Rhine, and, after crossing
that river, they would have found themselves in Ubian territory.

If we accept the MS. reading—ad confluentem Mosae et Rheni—
we must assume (1) that the Germane retreated from the positione
which they had taken up in the territories of the Eburones and
Condrusi to the country of the Menapii, which they had recently
left; (2) that Dion Cassius (xxxix, 48, ξ 2), who says that they
invaded the country of the Treveri, throu h which the Moselle
flows, either included the Condrusi and burones among the
Treveri or simply made a blunder 3 (3) that when the German
envoys offered to send a message to the Ubii and to get an
answer in three days, they were offerin‘g to perform a manifest
impossibility; (4) that confluentem means not ‘ confluence ’ but
⁸ connecting stream '-—the Waal—for obviously the Germane
would have fled not westward to the confluence of the Mense
and the Waal, but to the nearest point of the Waal, and even
then they would have had to cross the Rhine as well; (5) that
after the defeat of the Germans the Ubii asked Caesar to march
at least 70 miles up the valley of the Rhine and to cross the
river into their territory, although his narrative leaves on our
minds the impression that he crossed near the spot where he
had beaten the Germane.

If, on the other hand, we decide that the defeat took place
near the confluence of the Moselle and the Rhine, (1) our
decision flatly contradicts the MSS.; (2) we need not assume
that Caesar wrote Rheni when he meant Vacali or that con-
fluentem means ‘ connecting stream ’ς (3) we must assume that
the Germana moved away from the positione which they had
taken up in the territories of the Eburones and Condrusi, but
that instead of retreating in the direction whence they had
come they struck off through the Ardennes towards the south·
east and entered the land of the Treveri: (4) we must assume
that they had taken up a position about 70 miles, in a straight
line, from the nearest point of the Mense, to the further side of
which they had sent their cavalry on a foraging expedition
