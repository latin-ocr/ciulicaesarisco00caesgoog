COMMENTARIUS III 125

nostrorum se' tuto dimicaturos existimabant, tamen
tutius esse arbitrabantur obsessis viis commeatu inter-
cluso sine vulnere victoria potiri, et si propter inopiam 3
rei frumentariae Romani se recipere coepissent, im-

5 peditos in agmine et sub sarcinis infirmiores animo
adoriri eogitabant. Hoc consilio probato ab ducibus, 4
productis Romanorum copiis, sese castris tenebant.
Hac re perspecta Crassus, cum sua cunctatione atque 5
opinione timoris hostes nostros milites alacriores ad

expectari diutius non oportere quin ad castra iretur,
cohortatus suos omnibus cupientibus ad hostium castra
contendit.

ξ 3. infirmiores is an emendation, due to J. Kvieala. The
reading of a is infirmiore, of β inferiore, which is obviously
wrong. Infirmiore animo could onl refer to the Romans; but,
as Meusel remarks (J. Β., 1β94, p. 28⁷2), syntax requires that the
words should be taken w1th adoriri eoyitabant and therefore
refer to the Aquitanians. W. Paul simply deleted infirmiore
animm but, as Meusel says, something corresponding with
impeditos is evidently desirable after sub sarcinis. Klotz (C. S„
pp. 249-50), who cannot see why the Aquitanians should have
expected the Romans to fight with less cour-aye in a difficult
position, proposes to read firmiore animo ; but his objection is
surely answered b iv, 24, ⁴§§ 2-4.

ᾗ 5. timoris. Τ e MSS. have timidiores, which yields no sense.
w1th Meusel and other editors 1 have adopted the emendation
of Stephanus‚—timoris; but as Meusel says (J. Β., 1894, p. 273),
it is hardly satisfactory. fior, after sua cunctatione, opinione
would naturally be an opinion held hy the enemy, whereas the

remar s that munitionibusque does not necessari y imply that
the cam had any other fortifications [for example, a mumulo}
except t e rampart and ditch. He. says that if Caesar ha
written vallo only, his readers might have inferred that the
fortifieation was a mere makeshist3 and that if he had written
munitionibus only, they would not have known whether the
camp was fortified in the Roman fashion or in some outlandish
