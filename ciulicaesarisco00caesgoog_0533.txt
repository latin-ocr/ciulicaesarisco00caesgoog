APPENDIX 43⁷

Gaesar’s statement of the numbers of the Helvetian host.
The professor, who holds that Caesar habitually and deli-
berately exaggerated the numbers of his enemies‚¹ referred
to a familiar sentence in his account of the destruction of
Sabinus’s brigade—Erant et virtute ct numero puynandi
pares (v, 34, § 2)—from which he concluded that the
brigade was annihilated by an equal number of Gauls, and
therefore that Caesar could not have defeated the Helvetii
if they had been as numerous as he says. But the passage
in question is notoriously corrupt and, as it stands in the
MSS„ untranslatable; Gaesar's narrative (v, 26-37) shows
that Sabinus’s force was greatly outnumbered by the
Eburones 3 it is incredible that Ambiorix would otherwise
have ventured to attack a fortified Roman camp, situated
on a commanding position ς and Professor Delbruck
himself justly remarked that Roman armies overcame
superior numbers by superior discipline. Let us therefore
test Caemr’s statement about the Helvetii on its own
merits.

Caesar had four veteran legions in the battle (i, 24, ξ 2).
As we have seen (7, § 2), the ideal strength of a legion in
his time was 6,000 men: these four legions had apparently
suffered little or no loss before they went into action ; and
it is reasonable to suppose that immediately before the
battle they numbered about 2Ο,ΟΟΟ. The original strength
of the allied Gallio force, according to the Helvetian
schedule (29, ξ 2), was 92, 000. About one-fourth had
been destroyed or dispersed in the affair on the left bank
of the Saone (12, ἐξ 2-3); the natural rate of mortality
and casualties in the skirmishes recorded in 15, §3 would
account for the loss of a few hundreds more. Accepting
provisionally the Helvetian estimate, we may suppose that
on the day of the battle the allies numbered about 68‚000.
Is it credible that 2Ο,ΟΟΟ Roman veterans defeated 68,000
brave but undisciplined semi-barbarians ⁴? I gathered from
Professor Delbrnck’s remarks that, consider-ing the power
of discipline, he was willing to admit that a Roman army
might have defeated a Gallie force which outnumbered it
in the proportion of 2 to 1 or even of 5 to 2; and⁴I may
add that the efficiency of the allied force would have been
weakened by its consisting of tribal groups which lacked
interdependence and cohesion. It was for this reason
among others that Sir Charles Napier defeated an army of

tions, which may have been due to erroneous reporta. Professor
Delbrfiek in his lectures did not specifically refer to the question
of tibzoflelgetii, which he had discussed before. See my note
