THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL xxix

· natives whom they conquered, we should have to admit,

first, that the language which the Celts found spoken
not only in Gaul and Britain, but also in Switzerland
and Spain, was Celtic; secondly, that Celtic was spoken
by the aborigines of the Stone Age in Gaul and Britain,
Switzerland and Spain, for if it was not, some invaders
must have imposed it; and, lastly, that if the aborigines
of the British Isles and of Gaul spoke Celtic, Celtic must
have branched off from the primitive ‘ Indo-European ’
1811311839, from which the languages of Persia, Afghani·
stan, and Northern Hindostan, as well as most of the
languages of Europe, are descended, in the Palaeolithic
Age! Besides, if the aborigines of the British Isles
spoke Gaelic, why did not the Brythons‚ who conquered
them, and whose language was the ancestor of Welsh,
leam Gaelic from them? If the Celts did not speak
Celtic when they invaded Gaul and Britain, how are the
numerous Celtic place-names in Germany to be accounted
for *Ρ Do they not prove that the Celts spoke Celtic
before they crossed the Rhine ‘? Every one admits that
the language of the Belgae was Celtic: they certainly
did not learn it from the Gauls whom they found in pos-
session, for Caesar says that they expelled them ;¹ there·
fore they must have spoken it when they invaded Gaul.
Surely we may infer that the Celts who had already con·
,quered the rest of Gaul did the same. Q

Celtic was spoken in two of the three divisions of Gaul,
—those which were inhabited by the Celtae and the Bel·
gae respectively. But was the language everywhere the
same, or were there two dialects, as there are in the Celtic
regions of Great Britain,—-Wales and the Scottish High-
lands ‘? It is certain that in Caesar’s time the Belgae
and most of the Celtae, as well as the bulk of the Britons
who dwelt south of the Cheviot Hills, spoke the language
which is called Brythonic, and from which are descended
the languages which are now spoken in, Wales and part

literally; but, admitting this, all analogy is opposed to the assump-
tion that the Belgae did not speak Celtic before they crossed the

Rhine.
