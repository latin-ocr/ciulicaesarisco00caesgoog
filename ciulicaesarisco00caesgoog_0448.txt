356 DE BELLO GALLICO

ξ 8. equitatus . . . coeperunt. Caesar does not expressly say
that the circumvallation in the plain was attacked; and if ιι
was, his whole narrative (ch. 84-8) shows that the attack was
feeble. The bulk of the relievi force was formidable only in
numbers3 and the one division w ich attached the circumvalla·
tion in earnest was that commanded b Vercassivellaunus
(85, ᾖ 5-6; 87, ξ 5). 'I'he Aedui were ·hearted‚ if not
actua treacherous (63, ξ 8) ; and probabl most of the rnen
who be ongecl to the relievi army, except ercassivellaunns's
picked 60,000, were praeticffiy a mob (G. G.. pp. 815-16, 821—4).

84, ξ 1. a castris . . . sert. a omits a. Many commentators
have adopted an emen ation‚ mutes (fascina), on the ground
that Vercingetorix would not have marched out of Alesia
through his camp, which was on its eastern side (69, ξ 5), in
order to attack Caesar’s works in the plain of Les Laumes,
which was on the west. Long replied that it would have been
inconvenient to keep sappers' huts and heavy implements in
Alesia itself and easier to carry them from the camp to the
plain than to bring them down the steep western side of
the hill. This is a sound argument: but the emendation mgiy
be right nevel-theless3 and it has been ingeniously defend .
Supposing that it is right, some ancient reader who had noticed
the reading emtis may have written a. emtis on his copy,
opposite or above castras, a. being an abbreviation of aliter (other-
wise) ; and the scribe who wrote the archetype of Β may have
misunderstood a. and written α castris by mistake for a. emtis
(C. G„ p. 815). Musoeclos is found only in χε φ β have mule-ulos,
a word which does not exist. Meusel suggests that Caesar wrote
mur-ales (falces); but, as Klotz (C.S.‚ p. 178, n. 3) points out,
Caesar would not have put the ad'ective before the noun unless.
as in iii, 14,§ 5, he had wishe to emphasize it. If Caesar
wrote musculo-9, this is the only passage in the Gallie War in
which the word occure. It denotes a sappers’ hut. A musculus,
which is minutely described in B. 0., 1i, 10. was used in the
siege of Massilia: but itwas devised foraspecial urpose; andis
Vercingetorix used musculi, we can only say t at they were
intended to protect his men while they were attempting ιο fill

up Caesar's trenches.
