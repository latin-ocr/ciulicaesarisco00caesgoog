some powerful baron, stimulated by ambition or impressed
by the evils of disunion, succeeded in clutching the power
of a Bretwalda‚¹ he was forthwith suspected by his brother
nobles of a design to revive the detested monarchy, and
was lucky if he escaped the stake. The country swarmed
with outlawed criminals, who had fied from justice, and
