INTRODUCTION liii

Cicero had visited it he might perhaps have spoken with
less disdain of the urban life of the Gauls.¹ StreetS,
workshops, ramparts have been revealed by excavation.
Fifteen hundred coins, nine-tenths of which belonged to
the period of independence, testify to the manisold com·
mercial relations of the inhabitants. The houses show
that the round conical wooden huts which Strabo de-
scribed were only the more primitive productione of
Gaulish domestic architecture. Like them, indeed, the
houses at Bibracte were partly subterranean, this form
having been adopted as a precaution against cold on such
a high altitude, and probably, like the modern cottages
of the Morvan‚ they were thatched with straw; but their
shape was rectangular, they were built of stone compacted
with clay, and they were entered by an interior staircase.
The crucibles, moulds, and polishing·stones of enamel·
workers, broken tools, brocches, and pottery, all belong,
like the coins, to the latest period of the Celtic Iron Age.
Besides these relics of native workmanship were painted
vases, imported from Italy, which Gallic artificers soon
learned to imitate.

But the growth of material prosperity had not been
matched by true national progress. The Aquitani, indeed,
the maritime tribes, and the Belgae were untouched by
foreign influences; but the Celticans of the interior had
been enfeebled by contact with Roman civilization. Much
nonsense has been written about the enervating effect of
luxury. Its effect, however, when it is suddenly intro·
duced among a half-civilized people, is quite different
from its effect when it is a natural growth. The Gauls
had lost the strength of barbarism, and had not gained
the strength of civilization. They had once, as Caesar
remarked,² been more than a match for the Germans; but
enervated by imported luxury, and cowed by a succession
of defeats, they no longer pretended to be able to-eope
with them.

The reader will have gathered from the foregoing pages Politieal

and social
