ξ 5. metiri. It is very doubtful, as Meusel remarks (J. Β., 1910,
p. 335), whether Caesar ever used oportere except with an
accusative and infinitive or (which comes to the same thing)
with a passive infinitivo used impersonally.—for example, eon-
clamant . . . ad castra ἐνὶ oportere (iii, 18, ξ 5). We may there-
fore conclude that, although metior is a deponent verb, metiri
is here (and in 23, § 1) used passively.

praeerat. Praeerant is found in all the MSS.; but during ⁴
the last three centuries editors have almost unanimously substi-
tuted for it praeerat ; and if Caesar wrote the plural, he certainly
did so by a slip of the pen. For if he had meant praeerant, he
would of course have written not quem veryobretum‚ but quos
veryobret033 and that, at all events among the Aedui, only one
Vergobret could legally hold office at a time is proved by a
well-known passage in vii, 32, ξ 3,—3ummo esse in periculo rem,
quod, cum sinquli mayistratus antiquitus creari atque maiam
potestatem annum obtinere consuessent, duo maffia-tratum yet-ant
et se uter ue eorum leyibus creatum dicat (C.G., p. 505-7).

6. ἕπε, as in 14,§ 3 (quod eo invito, διο. , it· would be a
mistake to translate quod by ‘because '. The meaning is that
Caesar ‘ took them seriously to task for not helping him ⁹, διο.

possit. The MSS. have posset, which Meusel (J. Β., 1894,
p. 371) correcte for reasons which are obvious.

multo etiam . . . queritur. If these words are genuine, Caesar
means that ‘what he com lained of more seriously still was
that they [the Aedui] had p ayed him false ’,—they had not only
failed to supply him with corn, but had also broken their
promise. Meusel, however (J. Β., 1910, pp. 49-50 , thinks that
sit destitutus means substantially the same as t e preceding
non sublevetur, and was added by a reader who needlessly trie
to strengthen what Caesar had written. 1 do not feel sure that
the passage is spurious ; but it is certainly suspicions.
