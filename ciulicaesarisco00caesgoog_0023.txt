CREDIBILITY OF CAESAR'S NARRATIVE xvii

mistakes in military histories arise, I believe that Ι can
form a tolerably just idea of the meaning of Pollio’s
criticism. Caesar inevitably made mistakes3 and Pollio
may have conversed with eyewitnesses who pointed out
these mistakes, who were perhaps aggrieved by them,
and who, exaggerating their importance, as men who
have no sense of historical proportion will always dc,
shrugged their shoulders and exclaimed, ‘ Such is history.’
Gaesar’s accuracy has been confirmed, on various points,
by modern investigatione. Every one who has seen the
places which he described will admit that he was gifted
with the faculty of observation. Most of the opera
tiens which are pictured in his narrative were performe

under his own eye: he had opportunities for observin

what happened in a battle or a siege which a modern
general, whose operations extend over a vast area, cannot
have ; and he very rarely indulges in that sort of detailed
description which gives rise ιο most of the mistakes that
are made in modern military histories. This is a point
which Ι could not make perfectly clear to a ‘ general
reader’ unless he would listen attentively while Ι ex·
plained to him the labour which Ι have myself undergone
in writing an account of a modern battle and the process
by which Ι have been enabled ιο correct mistakes which
had crept into my original draft. But all who have tried
to write military history from original sources will under-
stand what Ι mean. As a rule Caesar gives us only the
outline of a battle,—he tells us just so much as may
enable us to understand the moveS, and no more. He
sent dispatches ιο the Senate, and it may be assumed that
he kept copies of them: his generals sent reports to him ;
and he finished his book within a year after the close
of the war. His account, therefore, was a contemporary
account by the eyewitness who had the best eyes, the
most favourable point of view, and the most trustworthy
information.

As for the speeches which he puts into the mouths
of Vercingetorix and others, nearly all are very short and
written, like many reports in newspapers of speeches, in
Oratio obliqua, which shows that he only professed ιο give
