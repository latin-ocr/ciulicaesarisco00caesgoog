406 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX

Ambustis-The name Ambarri is probably derived from
Ambsmrff, which means ‘those who dwell on both banks of
the Arar’, or Saone3 and any one who bas carefully read
Caesam narrative i, 10, ξ 5-12, ξ 2) will have seen that they
dwelt between the hone and the Saone. Their neighbonrs on
the south were the Segusiavi and the Allobroges; on the west
and north the Aedui3 and on the north-east and east the
S uani. Their territory, then, corresponded a proximately
wesdi the department of the Ain (C. G„ pp. 36545.

Ambiani.—The chief town of the Ambiani was Samaro-

mffibffl.—sse Ambibarii are included in Caesar's list of
the Aremorican‚ or maritime, tribes (vii, 753 ξ 4), which dwelt
between the Scine and the Loire3 but this is the only passage
in ancient literature in which they are named. Their position
is therefore uncertain: but it is generally believed that they
were identical with the Abrincatui, who are mentioned by
Ptolemy (Gema, ii, 8, ξ 8), but not b Caesar, and who occupied
the diocese of Avranches (Ο. G, pp. 66—7).

Ambiliati.—B. G„ iii, 9, δ 10 is the only passage in ancient
literature in which the Ambiliati are mentioned; and for want
of evidence 1 have not marked them on the map.

Ambivareti.—The geographical position of this tribe is
unknown (Ο. G„ .367-8).

ambivarita—‘f'his tribe is mentioned by no ancient writer

is called mbiani (see p. 403); and we may infer

exce t Caesar, and its whereabouts cannot be determined: we
only now that it was west of the Mense. This much is cert-ain,
because the Usipetes and Tencteri, who sent their cavalry
across the Meuse (trans Mosam) into the country of the
Ambivariti (iv, 9, 3), were then in the territories of the
Eburones and Con rusi (6, ξ 4), of whom the former dwelt

Ancalites—The Ancalites, the Bibroci, and the Cassi do
not reappear in history after the time of Caesar. They were
evidently de endent tribes, and nothin is known about their

to the Trinovantea rofessor Haverfield suggests that the
Bibroci may have been in Berkshire (A.B., p. 346 and n. 4).
I am inclined to believe that all three lived south of the
Thames3 for otherwise they would have been de endants of
Cassivellaunus, whose territory (v, 18, ξ 1) was on t e northern
bank, and would probably bave been prevented by fear os
Cassivellaunus from surrendering.

Alidem—Their chief town was Juliomagus, or Angers
(Ptolemy, Geoqr„ ii, 8, §8) ; and their territory corresponded
approximately with the diocese of Angers, that is to say, the
