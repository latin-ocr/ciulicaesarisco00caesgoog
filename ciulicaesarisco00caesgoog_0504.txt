the steep and rocky flanks of the hill and over ground consider-
ably higher than that on which the fort is supposed to have
stood3 and since the hill of Namnr is only one of a chain of
continuone heigbts, it is hard to see why the Atuatuci should
have restricted the fort within absurdly narrow limits. A ⁹ ,

describes in 33, ξ 2 ⁸? Not down the gentle slope, which would
have been occupied by the Roman ayyer, or siege terrace. As
far as 1 can see, they must either have headed north-westward
along the low ground parallel with the Sambre, or southward
alon the eastern flank of the hill or the narrow stri of ground
para el with the Mense. But in either case, i they had
succeeded in storming the contravallation (33, §§ 3-4), would
they not have been trapped between river and hill ⁴?

Mont Falhize was an ideal site for a Gallie stronghold ; but
no Gallio antiqnities have been found on it, and although it is

towards the hill. Possibly the slope may have been obliterated
by the earth and rnbble of which Caesar's terrace would have
been largely composed. Von Goler, indeed, insiste that there is
a slope, which rises 20 feet: bnt 1 believe my eyes ; and Ι affirm
that, if it exists at all, it is quite insignificant.

The reader may perhaps have noticed that there is one
objection common to Namnr and to Mont Falhize. The former
is between the Mense and the Sambre, and the latter is washed
on its southern side by the Meuse; bnt Caesar does not mention
any river. Yet, if there was one, he might have been ex cted
to say sc, for it would have served as a natural contrave. ation
and thus have enabled him to make his entrenchment much
smaller than it would otherwise have been (C. 0., . 387-93).

Aulerci Brannovioes.—The territory of the rannovices.
who were dependants of the Aedui, is perhaps represented by
the canton of Brionnais‚ on the eastern bank os the upper
Loire ; bnt we have no clue except the name (C. G„ p. 393).

Aulerci cenomanie-'Phe territory of the Cenomani corre·

of vreux‚ which preserves their name, and w ich embraces
the central and the southern part of the department os the
Eure (0. G„ p. 393-4).

Ausci.- is tribe possessed the southern part of the diocese
of Auch, that is to say, the central and the southern part of the
department of the Gers (C. G„ p. 394).

Avaricum stood upon the site of Bourges.

Bacenis (silva).—This forest probably extended southward
from the mountains of Thurin ‘a.

Belgium is mentioned in t e Fiflh commentar-y three times
(12, ξ 2; 24, 2; 25, § 4), or, according to the a MSS„ which
in the secon pass e have Belyis instead of Bezyio, twice.
In chapter 12, πὶιίἓὶ is perhaps s urions, Belyio apparently
means the country of the Belgae; or if it meant only a part
of that country, how could the reader tell what part ‘was meant?
Again in 25, ξ 4 Belyio seems to mean the country of the
