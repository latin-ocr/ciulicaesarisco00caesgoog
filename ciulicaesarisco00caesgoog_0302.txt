220 DE BELLO GALLICO

demonstravimus, repetit, qui litteras ad Caesarem

3 deferat. Hunc admonet iter caute diligenterque
faciat. Perscribit in litteris hostes ab se discessisse

4 omnemque ad eum multitudinem convertisse. Quibus
litteris circiter media nocte Caesar adlatis suos facit 5
certiores eosque ad dimicandum animo confirmat.

Gallum (alium ab eodem Vertit-one, because· Gallum without
alium would evidently mean the slave who is mentioned in
45, ξ 3, and in this case Caesar would certainly have written
Gallum eundem. But does not the reading of β s gest that
Caesar did write Gallum eundem ⁴? If so, the slave ha returned
to his master, just as the spy Ungud returned to Lucknow again
and again during the Indian Mutiny3 and in favour of this
supposition it may be said that, as we may infer from 45, ξ 4,
the slave might safely have returned, and that if he had not
already returned, Caesar would probably have employed him

i, 44), that the pronoun referred ιο Gallum3 but I am now
inclined ιο believe that Long (D. R. R„ iv, 229) is right in
identifying it with Caesarem.

ξ 6. tantulis. The reading of β is cum tantis, which yields
equally good sense, and, moreover, as Meusel says (J. B.‚ 1894.
p. 300), seems to follow rather more naturally the preceding
multitudinem hostium. Nevertheless, Ῑ adhere‚ as Meusel him-
self habituall does when there are not sufficient grounds for a
decision, to e reading of a.

ξ 7. viarum. Passages crossed a Roman camp from front to
rear and from side to side. of the latter the principal (via
principalis) connected the porta prInct‘pah's dextra with the porta
principalis sini-scm. From the centre of the via princi is to the
porta praetoria-the front gate of the camp-exten ed the via
praetor-ia. Just inside the rampart a passage, in which the army
was formed up when it was about to march out, ran right round
