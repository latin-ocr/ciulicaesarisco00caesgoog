gives were called' after the goddesses Matrona and Deva:

It is harffily nehessarg to tell thegrgdeffsthat the Celts had
their own names for t e five great gods whom Caesar called
Mercury. Apollo, MarS, Jupiter, and Minerva. The Celtic
names, if Caesar knew them, would have meant nothin ιο his
Italian readers3 but the Celtic gods whom he called by man

the Gauls whom he consulted,—probably from the Druid‚
Diviciacus. But second-hand information must be received
with cantion. We are told that when the French musician,
Felicien David, was invited by the Viceroy of Egypt to instruct
his wives, etiquette compelled him to ’ve the Iessons to a
eunuch, who passed them on as well as e could. Diviciacus

· was in the position of Felicien David, Caesar of the eunuch.

Even animal-worship, or a decayin temnant of animal-
worship‚ has left traces in Celtic art. e boar was especially
sacred. As we have seen (in the note on iv, 15, ξ l)‚the Gauls, like
the Romans, had military standards, which were in their eyes
sacred: like the Romans also, they carried not a fig, but vhe
figure of an animal, and with them this animal was commonly
the boar. Traces of animal-worshi ‚ indeed, survive in Gallie
tribal names: the Brannovices (vii, 5, ξ 2) were ‘ the people of
the raven ¹, the Eburones ‘ the people of the boar '. 'I'he worship
pf animals‚ which at first sight may appear merely unintelli 'ble
and absurd, had a meaning. Animals were worshi pe by
primitive tribes because they were formidable or won erful or
possessed powers that men had not; because men fancied that
they were incarnations of deity3 or because they might be
possessed by the souls of ancestors.

This note is not intended to give an account of Celtic
reli 'on‚ which would require many pages‚ but only to let the
renger understand that there is a great deal to be learned about
the subject besides what Caesar has told us, and to put him
in ιὲιέ ἔξω* of informing himself (A. B., pp. 271-86 ς QG„
pphm'us . . . simulacra. No pre-Roman Celtic statues have ever
been sound3 accordingly M. Salomon Reinach has suggested
that Caesar was thinkzng of menhirs, or standing stones‚ like
those which tourists may see in Cornwall and Brittany. Menhirs
had been erected long before the first Celt set foot in Gaul ; but
M. Reinach thinks that, like the formless stones which the Greeks
venerated as emblems of Hermes, they were believed by the
Celtg to 1be possessed by the spirit of Mercury. See C. G„
