regards the difference between ten years and nine years and
ten months as negligible3 and, although direct evidence is
wanting, he has no doubt that the provincial commands which
Pompey and Crassus secured in the conference at Luca were to
be in not on March 1, 54 Β. 0., but, in aecor-dance with pre·
ce ent, on January 1, and that Caesar's administration was
not to outlast theirs. Itis needless to examine this novel theory
here; for J udeich evidently accepts the view that urtam aesta·
tem mJeans the summer of 50 Β. 0., and that is the important
point.

proet'nm‘ae means ‘ government ’ or ‘ term of office '. Caesar
never uses the word in this sense.

ξ 4. iustis itineribus. A iustum iter was an ordinary day‘s
march. The length would of course vary according to the
nature and condition of the road and the size of the army: but
Lord Wolseley (The Solde‘er's Paelex-Book, 5th ed„ p. 322) re·
marks that the ‘length of ordinary marches, sor a force not
larger than one division, moving by one road, should be from
12 to 16 miles a day, for 5 days out of 6, or at most 6 days out
of 7 '; and we may be sure that Roman armies, which were
much less encumbered by transport, marched at least as well
(see C. 0., p. 635). F. Stolle (Das Layer und Heer det· Rbmer,
1912, pp. 40—6) infers from B. 0., iii, 76 that the length of a
iustum iter was not more than about 8 Roman, or rather less
than 74 English miles. From this chapter we learn that Caesar
made a iustum iter from Dyrrachium to Asparagium, and after·
warde on the same day marched 8 Roman miles further (dupli-
cat ue eius diei itinere VIII milia passuum ex eo loco procedit).
Stol e insists that duplicato is to be understood literally‚ and
therefore that the iustum iter was 8 miles. Unfortunately for
this theory (which no soldier would think worth refuting) the
distance from Dyrrachium to Asparagium is 16 Roman miles;
and it is therefore evident that, as Meusel says, duplicato itinere
simply means ‘ making a second march ’.
