THE GREDIBILITY OF CAESAR’S
NARRATIV E

Fon the history of the first seven years of ansar’s
conquest of Gaul our principal authority is Caesar him-
self. It is, indeed, impossible to grasp the full meaning
of his narrative without the help of the modern scholars
who have contributed so much to the task of solving the
problems which the Commentaries present. It is true,
moreover‚ that Cicero’s writings illustrate certain phases
of the war, and that later writers, such as Suetonius,
Plutarch, and Dion CassiuS, make certain statementS,
true or false, which are not to be found in Caesar. But
Caesar is the authority; and thoughtful readers will want
to know how far his narrative is trustworthy. According
to Suetoniu8,¹ Pollio, who served ,under Caesar in the civil
war, thought that the Commentaries were written carelessly
and with little regard for truth ; that Caesar had accepted
without due inquiry the reports of his officers; and that,
either intentionally or from failure of memory‚ he was
inaccurate in describing what he had done himself. Now
it is almost certain that Pollio was referring to Gaesar’s
commentar-ies cm the civil War, with which we are not
here concerned ;2 but suppose that he had the same opinion
of the Gallie lVar. If so, as he did not serve in Gaul,
he could only have repeated what he had heard from
others3 and their opinions would have been of no value
except about what they had seen themselves, As I have
learned from conversation with men who had taken part
in Sir Charles Napier’s conquest of Sind and in the Indian
Mutiny‚ and from letters which they wrote to me, how

² According to Suetonius, Pollio thought that Caesar would have·
rewritten and corrected his narrative if he had had an opportunity-3
(existimatque rescripturum et correcturum fuisse). A. Klotz (th. M„ 1911 ,Ι
p. 81) remarks that Pollio could hardly have said'this in regat-d tm
the Commentarae‘es on the Gallie War, which were published by Caesar
himself.
