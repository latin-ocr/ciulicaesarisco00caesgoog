Hic pagus unus, cum domo exisset, patrum nostrorum 5

consilio deorum immortalium quae pars civitatis

P ξ 3. Eos impeditos . . . abdiderunt. According to Appian
(Celtica, 1, ξ 3) and Plutarch Caesar, 18), it was not Caesar who
defeated the Tigurini, but La ienus; and it has been said that
Plutarch's words—mlx αὐτὸς ἀλλὰ Λαβιηνός- show that he intended
to correct Caesar. But, supposing that hs did, what reason is
there to believe that his statement is more trustworthy than
Gaesar's‘? Caesar gave 811111811811181181118, and especially Labienus,
full credit sor 111811· exploits3 and even if he had wished to rob
Labienus of his due, he 1111181 have known that every officer in
the army would detect his lie and would make the truth known
privately if not publicly. 1 believe that Plutarch and Appian
either drew hast inferences from the fact that Caesar, when he*
went back to 1 y sor reinforcements (10,§ 3 , had left Labienus
near the Pas de 1Ἐο11188, 11181 18, east of the 118, or, like some
modern writers, made the mistake of assuming that Caesar
himself was encamped on the west of the river. But, as
M. Camille Jullian suggests, it is quite possible that Labienus
ma have commanded a division under Caesar (C. G„ pp. 231-3).

an arm of the'Seine (vii, 58, ξ 4), by lashing bai-ges together.
