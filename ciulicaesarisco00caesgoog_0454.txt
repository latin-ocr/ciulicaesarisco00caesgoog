A. HIRTII

DE BELLO G‘ALLIOO
COMMENTARIUS OCTAVUS

Hirtius’s CoAcTos adsiduis tuis vocibus, Balbe, eum cotidiana
ffiffissfoey mea recusatio non difficultatis excusationem, sed

inertiae videretur deprecationem habere, difficillimam
2 rem suscepi: Caesaris nostri commentarios rerum
gestarum Galliae, non competentibus superioribus 5
atque insequentibus eius scriptis, contexui novissi·

Praef.,§ 1. Balbe. This preface was addressed by Hirtius
(see p. ix) to Balbus, a native of Gades (Gadis) in Spain, who,
like himself, was a friend and agent of Caesar.

difficultatis accusationem seems to mean literally not ‘an
excuse based upon difficulty ', but ‘a pleading of difficulty as
an excuse ’. Cf. B. C'.‚ iii, 20, ξ 3,—inopiam excusare.

§2. non competentibus . . . confeci. Com entibus is an emenda-
tion, proposed by Bernhardy, ins of the MS. reading,
comparantibus. Prof. J. S. Reid (a. Ph„ 1908, pp. 441-2) sug-
gests non comparentes—⁴ missing —and remarks that Hirtius
‘treats the writings which would have to be added to the
commentarii written by Caesar as commentar-ii that were
‘⁴ missing ’' ⁹. But the professor very pertinently asks ‘why
does Hirtius use the plural commentarios of Bell. Gau„ viii,
while the singular commentarium is applied (apparently) to the
remaiuder of the records which he intended to compile ⁴? It is
better, perham, to suppose that Galliae has intruded itself here
from the title of MSS. of the “ Gallie War”; commentarios will
then apply to the whole of the com ilations taken in hand by
Hirtius. In that case the words rom* novissimumque imper·
fectum onward give a description of the later of the two

rtions implied in commentarios. There is in these words,
fobelieve, a slight ellipse. Hirtius means that he finished
the book containin the Alexandrino war, and carried on the
story (in other books to the death of Caesar! The MSS. have
novissimum quae, which is obviously wrong· and for which in
the editio princeps was substituted notissima ue. Meusel now
adopts an emendation proposed by H. Sch ‹sn—novissimum
atque imperfectos. 1 agree with Klotz (C.S.‚ pp. 155-6) that
novissimumque imperfectum is right. Suetonius (Divus Iulius, 56),
who evidently used Hirtius as his authority, says that Hirtius
Gallici belli novissimum imperfectum ue librum su evem3 and,
as Klotz points out, he carelessly ressrred what 'rtius had said
about the continuation of Caesar's last book on the civil war to
the Gallie war. By contexui Hirtius meant ‘I continued’,
that is, filled up the gap between the Sonenth commentam on the
