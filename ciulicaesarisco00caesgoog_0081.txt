ξ 3. dicerent. See the second note on 3, §4. In final relative
clauses Caesar uses the present subjunctive after an historic
present much oftener than the imperfect. Here the imperfect
may be due to the influence of obtinebant (.J B„ 1894, p. 356,
3615. lf the reader does not quite under-(stand what ¹1) mean,
an ιι glish example will make it clear. In a book written by
a distinguished scholar this sentence occurs. ‘It would have
been easy enough for Vi l to have taken up at once the heroic
vein in the man ἰΑοιιθιιο ‘To have takenp u 'ought lo ically
to be‘ to take up but te perfect was loose y used un er the

§4. L. Caesium. This officer was defeated in 107 Β. 0. by
the Tigurini see 12, §§ 4-7), one of the four Helvetian tribes.
Accordingto t e Epitome of Li (ch. 65, with which cf. Orosius,
v, 15, §§ 23- 4), the defeat too place in the country of the
Nitiobroges, which corres nded with the departments of Lot·
et-Garonne and Tarn- et ronne. Mr. W. E. Heitland has

gested to me that when the Helvetii determined to settle m
W{stem Gaul (Β. G„ i, 10, §)1), they may have been influencecl
by y5t5b5e recollection of what the Tigurini had achieved (C. G„
p subt ) iuyum. The ‘’yoke was composed of two j'avelins
planted ιιι the ground and crossecl above hya third. The troops
were diearmed before they defiled under>⁷ it; and m doin
they were of course obliged to stoop, and were mocked by t eir
