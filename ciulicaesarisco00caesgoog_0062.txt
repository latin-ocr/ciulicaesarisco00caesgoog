for retainers to desert their lords even when all is lost ' ἱ) ¹
If the Gauls had been unmolested or had been exposed to
attack only from a single enemy, it seems probable that,
in the fullness of time, some great ruler might have
welded them into a united nation. But menaced as they
were by the Germans on one side and by the Romans on
another, their tendency to disunion was increased. And,
though it is foolish to pass sweeping judgements upon
a people of whom, except during the few years that pre-
ceded the loss of their independence‚ we have only the
scantiest knowledge, it would be a great mistake to leap
to the conclusion that, in political capacity, one race is as
good as another. No one would deny that the Greeks
were endowed with a genius for art and literature which
their environment doubtless helped to develop3 and it
may be that the Celts were but poorly endowed with
political talent, and that circumstances had helped to
stunt its growth. The important fact is, explain it as
we may, that the tribal rulers of Gaul had not achieved
even that first step towards unity which the kings of
Wessex achieved when they swallowed up the petty
kingdoms of the Heptarchy. Or perhaps it would be
more true to say that, when the Romans first established
themselves on the west of the Alps, the Arvernian king
had achieved that step; but that first his defeat on the
banks of the Rhene, and afterwards the revolution which
subverted the royal power, had broken the ascendancy of
his house and dealt a fatal blow to the political develop-
ment of Gaul. There, as in Latium, the downfall of the
monarch inevitably weakened the power of the tribe3
and the oligarchieS, if they had the power, were not
granted the time to work out their own salvation. Indi-
vidual tribes, such as the Aedui and the Arverni, did
indeed achieve some sort of supremacy over their weaker
neighbours3 and in certain cases two tribeS‚ for example
the Senones and the Parisii, formed one state. There
were leagues of the Belgae, the Aquitani, and the maritime
tribes». But supremacy had not hardened into sovereignty;
and the leagues were loose, occasional, and uncertain. If
