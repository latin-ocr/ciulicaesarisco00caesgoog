( ’Θῗξξ 1. )Ιοεο . . . capto. It has been shown in the note on
iv, 23, 6 that Caesar lauded in 55 Β.ο. between Walmer and
Deal. e un uestionably lauded in the same ‘part of the
island ' (v, 8, 3 that is to say, in East Kent-in 54; for
it is incredible t at he should have lauded in 55 on one side,
and in 54 on the other side of the South Foreland; and before
his fleet hove in s' ht in 54 the Britons assembled in great
force to ο pose his nding (8, ῗ 6), which shows that they felt
sure that e would attempt to and at or near the place where
he had landed the year before (Α.Β., pp. 603-4). But most
probably the lace was not exactly the same. As we shall

resently see ( ξ 2-3), on the morning after the disembarkation

aesar fought an action on the banks of the Great Stour about
12 miles from his camp, and the camp must therefore have been
in the neighbourhood of Sandwich. Moreover‚ Caesar tells us
(ξ 1) that when he quitted the camp he felt little anxiety
for his shi s, as he was leaving them at anchor on a nice open
shore; an , although no other commentator bas noticed the
fact, any one can see that he was here excusing himself for not
having hauled his ships ashore, notwithstanding the severe
lesson which the storm of the previous year had given him
(iv, 29), by the plea that he had selected a more favourable
anchorage. The anchorago in the Small Downs is much more
secure than in the Downs (A. Β., pp. 664-5).

cohortibus X were equivalent to one legion: but as Caesar

does not say una 102in, we may infer that the eohorts were
selected from the five legions.
