valley of the Rhine also disappears.

Hard as it is ιο decide,I am tempted ιο conclude that the
Germana fied to the confluence of the Mosella and the Rhine ς
for as often as 1 read Caesar's narrative it leaves u on my mind
the impression that the rout took place opposite t e country of
the Ubii. First we see the German host marching southward
into Condroz and the adjacent country of the Eburones on the
east. A few marches further southward would bring them to
the neighbourhood of Coblenz. It seems ιο me quite in accord
with Caesar’s manner that, having already told us that they had
moved far from the country of the Menapii, he should have
omitted ιο mention these marches3 but 1 can hardly conceive
that if they had retreated northward 90 Roman miles, he would
have neglected ιο say so. Then their envoys ask for three days'
grace ιο negotiate with the Ubii; and (though the envoys
probably did not intend to negotiate at all) the natural con·
clusion seems to be that the Ubii 'were close by. Finassy, the
Ubii ask Caesar ιο bring his arm into their country ; and it is
not easy ιο believe that they wou d have asked him ιο march at
least 70 Roman miles before he could cross the Rhine. More-
over, Caesar tells us (ξ 2) that the fu 'tives who plunged into
the stream were overwhelmed ‘by t e force of the current'

poIt is hard y necessary ιο notice the views of the commentatore
who refuse ιο believe that the rout took lace either in the
neighbourhood of the Waal or in that of &obleua The only
one which seems worth mentioning is that of T. Bergk, who
holds that confluentem meant ‘ a river which flows into another
river ', that what Caesar really wrote was ad confluentem Mosae,
and that some one who could not understand the Latin added
et Rheni. Bergk believes that the confluens in question was the
Beer, and that the Germane fled ιο a point near the 'unction of
tihze R‹l)er and the Mense (C. G„ pp. 691-706). See t e note on

Τ at nearly 430,000 persons perished in the rout is incredible.
