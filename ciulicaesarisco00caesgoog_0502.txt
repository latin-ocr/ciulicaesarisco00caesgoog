west of the Mense and yet belonged to a people ‘the ter
art of whose territory is between the Mense and the “ e'
v, 24, ξ 4). There are several other passages which suggest
that Atuatuca was between the two rivers. Ambiorix, in his
interview with Gaius Arpineius and Quintus J unius, stated that
a body of Germans, who were coming to the assistance of the
Gallio rebels, had crossed the Rhine, and would ari-ive at
Atuatuca in two days (v, 27, ξ 8). Sabinus, in the eouncil
of war which immediately followed the interview, remarked
that the Rhine was close by (subesse Rhervum [29, ξ 3]),-ει phrase
which, one would think, he would hardly have used if the broad
flood of the Mense had intervened between the Rhine and
Atuatuca. We are told that when the Sugambri invaded the
country of the Eburones the crossed the Rhine (vi, 35, ἕως
but we are not told that, in or er to reach Atuatuca, they crossed
the Meuse. When they left Atuatuca ‘ they recrossed the Rhine '
(trans Rhenum sese receperunt [41, ξ l]) ; and this phrase would be
misleading if they had first had to cross so important a river as
the Mense. Furthermore, readers who have seen Tongres will
not easily believe that Caesar would have described it as a
naturally strong posit-ion. Except on the south and south-east,
where it is approached by a very entle ascent, it is natural]
defenoeless; and it was against t is side that the first attae
of the Sugambri would have been directed. How, then, eould
Caesar have said that ‘ the stt-cuych of the position as well as the
entrenchments forbade any attempt to enter elsewhere ' (reliquos
aditus locus ipseper se munitioque defendit [37,§ 51) ’ ⁴? It has
been argued that Caesar was thinking of marshes which pro-
tected the camp; but where could they have been except
between the south-east and the south-west, where they may
have been formed by the river Geer‘? And even they would
not have extended up to the supposed site os the camp.

No less than twenty-five other sites have been propoffl ; but
I doubt whether any of them is worth mentiomng exce t
Embourg, near Liege‚ east of the Mense and between e
Ourthe and the Vesdre, and Li mbourg, which is about 15 miles
east of Liege. The latter is the less objectionable, but it does
not answer satisfactorily to Caesar-'s description. For these

Atuatuci.—'l'he territory of this ople was between the
Nervii and the Eburones (v, 38, ἕξ 1-2 ς and the Eburones had
some territory west of the Mense -east of the Nervii and south
of the Menapii--though the greater part was between the
Mense and the Rhine (24, 4). South of the Meuse, in the
district of Condroz‚ were the ondrusi. Accordin ly the Atuatuci
are placed in the valley of the Mense, principal y along its lest
or northern bank, between the Nervi1 and the Condrusi, iu
other words, they possessed Namur and its neighbourhood, that
is to say, the district of Hesbaye, and perhaps also some little
territory in the western part of Condroz. If the reader will
study the passages of Caesar to which I have referred aud
consult the ma 8, he will agree with this conclusion.

But althoug the Atuatuci were confined within this small
area after their chief town had been captured by Caesar (see
