Belgae. But 24, ξ 2 presents a difficulty. The reading Belyae’s
would seem to have no point3 for besides the three le 'ons
which Caesar stationed ἐκ Belgis (or in Belgio) all the ot ers,
except one, were also quartered in the country of the Belgae.
On the other hand, supposing that Belgio is the true reading,
it is obvious that, unless Caesar was very careless, Belyu‘um can
only mean a art of the whole territory of the Belgae, If so,
what part ⁸? ige learn from 46,§ 1 that ope of the three le ‘ons
which were uartered 111 Belgium was in the country o the
Bellovaci, 11113 from Hirtius (viii, 46, ξ 6) that within the limits
of Bel um was Nemetocenna, the chief town of the Atrebates:
it is c ear, then, that Belgium must also have comprised the
country of the Ambiani, which was between the other two.
'Phe right reading is probably Bel92‘03 for it seems more likely
that the word Belgium was used in a restricted as well as in
a general sense than that Caesar used the word Belqae, the

Benovaoi.—'rhe Bellovaci possessed the diocese of Beauvais,
which preserves their name (Ο. G„ pp. 397-8).

Bibracte was identical, not, as was formerly believed, with
Augustodunum-the Gallo-Roman town which stood upon the
site of Autun—-but with a eat manufacturing town on Mont
Beuvray, 12 miles west of utun, whose defences, houses, and
workshops have been revealed b excavation (see p. lii). It
was abandoned early in the era o the Roman Empire, and suc·
ceeded by Augustodunum, which, as the late Professor Freeman
said (Hist. Essays, 4th ser„ pp. 103-5), ‘ was a new city on
a nlew sigefiiefibgffitely laid out from the beginning on a great

Bibiax wag 8 R)oman miles from the camp which Caesar
made in 57 Β. c, immediately after crossin the Aisne, and was
situated on or near the road by which t e Belgae advanced
against him (ii, 6, ξ 1). Only two of the many places with
which it has been identified, namely Beaurieux and Vieux·
Laon, answer sufficiently to his deseri tion to call for discus-
sion; and as we cannot tell with abso ute certainty what was
the road by which the Belgae advanced (see the first note on 5,
ξ 4), we cannot positively decide between them. Beaurieux is
about 8 Roman miles west of the hill of Manchamp, on which,
if Caesar crossed the Aisne at Berry·au·Bac‚ he encamped3 but,
as I have shown in the note on 8, §§ 3-5, it is very doubtful
whether he did cross there. Another objection is that Beau·
rieux, which is about two miles north of the Aisne, could have
been entirely surrounded by the Belgae, and therefore the
force which Caesar sent to the rclief of the garrison could not
have t into the fort (7, ξξ 1-2) unless the Belgae were ex-
tremefy) careless. ⁶

Vieux·11aon is at the re uired distance both from the hill of
Manchamp and from the p ateau of Pontavert‚ on which Caesar
must have encamped if he did not cross the Aisne at Berry·au·
Bac. The hill which is now occupied by the town of Laon was
once called Bibrax, and a little south of the plateau os Vieux·
Laon is a village which was once called Bebrieux. It has been
suggested that the inhabitants of Vieux·Laon abandoned it in
