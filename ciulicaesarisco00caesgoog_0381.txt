§ 2. legionibusque . . . mpeditus In β we find leyv‘ones (without
que) and mpeditus. Meusel (J. B„ 1894, pp. 326-8) rejects the
reading of a because if, as he concludes, in occulto is spurious
and mpeditus is here used adjectivally, the ablative absolute,
leyionsbus exepeditia would plainly be inadmissible. Intra vinetis
in occulto is the reading of β. Τ110 readings of a are extra tineas
(in χ), extra castra vineas (in φ), and extra castra vineasque in L,
in occulto being omitted in both χ and φ but not in L. None
of these three readings can be right ; for the first and the third
are pointless and the second is nonsense. Meusel says that
mpeditus can hardly be a participle, because expeditum in con·
nexion with leqiones, cohortes, &c.‚ is regularly an adjective3
and that, if it is an adjective, in occulto is impossible. He
points out that intra vineas must mean either inside individual
vinecw or within a space enclosed by vineae, and that troops
could only have been concealed by vineae if they had been
inside them ; and he scoffs at the notion that niueae would have
sufficed for the concealment of eight legions. Accordingly 110
brackets intra vineas in ecculm. But Caesar did not always
write with precision; and though only the foremost part of
the force could have been simultansously concealed intra vineas,
he might perha have spoken loosely of the legions as intra
vineas. '1'110 ing intra vineas in occulto derives some support
from the statement, which Caesar makes in the next sentence,
that the soldiers ⁸ suddenly darted forth fmm every point and
swiftly lined the wall ' (subito ex omnibus partibus evolaverunt
murum e celeriter compleverunt) ; butl do not deny that Meusel
is 'usti ed in bracketing the words.

JWhatever the right reading may be, this much is clear.
Caesar intended to surprise the enemy; and therefore he
concealed his troops somehow. If they had only been con-
cealed behind the 099ον and had become visible as soon as they
set foot upon it, the enemy would have had warning. There·
fore the head of the column, at all events, was probably formed
11 on the 099ενς and the only means of concealing them was to
p ace them inside the vineae or within a space enclosed by
vinme or both. The rest of the troops would have been con·
cealed either in the space between the viaducts (if Napoleon is
right in believin that the central portion of the aqyer occupied
