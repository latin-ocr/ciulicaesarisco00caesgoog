tumulus terrenus. It is generally taken for granted that this
was a natural feature‚—-a knoll. But if so, why did Caesar
describe it as tet-mnus (earthen)? He mentions four other
tumuli( vi, 8, 3; 40, ξ 1; Β. G„ i, 43, ξ 1; iii, 51, §8); but to
none of them oes he apply the epithet termus. It is true that
Livy (xxxviii, 20, ξ 4) speaks of colles ter-rems: but he is oon-
trasting them with rocky heights; and if the tumulus in
question was a knoll, it mattered nothing for the purpose of
Caesar’s narrative whether it was rocky or grassy. It is
certainly possible that it was simply an artificial earthen
mound or barrow, which has disap ared. If it vas a knoll,
there is only one with which it can e identified,—the ‘ tertre
