Gaul. But such a ‘democracy ’ is quite consistent with the
state of society described by Caesar, in which ‘ the masses are
regarded almost as slaves ’ and ‘never venture ιο act on their
own initiative ’. Still, although the plebs had not begun to
acquire definite political ower, they had the power of making
their wishes felt. A ἰιιῙῖ discussion of the question will be
found in C. G„ pp. 529-41.

concilio, the reading of ah, is, 1 believe, right, although
editors generally preferconsilio. 1 take it that the word here
means not ‘ deliberation ' but ‘council ’ (cf. vii, 77, ᾗ 3) ; and cou-
silium in Caesar, when it means ‘ a council '‚ is regularly used
of a council of war held by Roman officere.

2. Dinter‚ perhaps unnecesearily,'adds quibus after nobe’libus.
3. equitum here means ‘knights’‚ not ‘cavalry ’. The ‘knights ’

mentioned in this passage were the Gallie anstocracy, and the
‘men of rank' (nobilibus) mentioned in ξ 2 were the most
distinguished of the knights. See the note on i, 31, ξ 6. In·
telligent readers can always see in which of the two senses
Caesar uses the word aquius.

ξ 4. reliyiones,—‘ questions of religion ’.

ad hos . . . concurrit. Meusel (J. B.. 1910, p. 58) brackets
these words and therefore also hi. He argues (1) that the
statement is virtually repeated in 14, ξ 2; (2) that Caesar
would have written discendi, not disciplinae (causa); (3) that
the pronoune hos, hi, and eos are objectionable, for hos would
naturally refer to equitum and accordingly Nipperdey altered it
into eos, while the meaning of lu· and apud eos is obscure; and,
lastly, that the next sentence—Nam sere, Sec—would naturally
follow reliyt'ones inteqn‘etantur myrtoque sunt apud eos honore,
and that the connexion is s oiled by the intervening words
ad hos . . . concurrit. Now if tlie passage is genuine, it must be
admitted that Caesar did repeat himself 3 but in the case of
a ra id writer, who had no time to revise his work, this would
not e surprising. If Caesar wrote αιιωὶῑίἰ causa (ii, 24, §4)
and conloquii causo (Β. C„ i, 26, 23), why should he not have
written, sor once, disciplinae causa . Hos and ha· may be awkward,
but their meaning is clear 3 and as for eos, Meusel who says that
Caesar would never have expressed himself so badly as to use it
with reference to ‘the Gauls, who are nowhere mentioned '
(dio nir-ymas ,omnnem Galli), is of course obliged to retain it
and therefore tacitly to admit that Caesar did express himself
badly. I do not bracket the words; for 1 cannot see what
