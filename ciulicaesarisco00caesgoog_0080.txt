355 days, or, roughl , twelve lunar months ; and an additional
mouth, consisting a tei-nately of 22 and 23 days,was intercalated
every other year after the 23rd os February. This, however,
was an excessive correction, the excess amounting to 4 days

discretiori. This privilege they often abused, omitting an in·
tercalary month occasionauy, in order to please some governor
of a province who wished to return as soon as possible to Rome.
Between 58 and 45 13.c. only two months were intercalated;
and the result was that in 46 ae. the calendar was 90 days
in advance of the real time. In order to make it right, Caesar,
who was then Dictator, enacted that that year should contain
445 days. The date which he gives in this passage- a.d. V.
Kal. Apr·.— corresponded with March 24 of the Julian calendar
and wiltgilglarch7g2801s)our reformed calendar (Α. Β., pp. 706-26;

ξ 2. leyi'o una. This was one of the soui- le 'ons—the 7th, 8th,
9th, and lOth (see p. lxiii and 10, ξ 3)—whic Caesar had under
his command when he started for Gaul. In the time of Marius
the legion, on a war footing, was sup osed to number 6‚ooo men
(Appian, Mithra, 87,108) ; and the egions os Sulla (Plutarch,
Sulla, 93 Marius, 35) and of Lucullus (Appian, Μῶφι, 72) were
of the same strength. The organization of the army in the
time of Caesar remained the sanie; and we may infer stom one
of Cicero’s letters (Ata, ix, 6, ξ 3) and from Caesar's narrative
of the civil war (Β. 0., iii, 4, ξ 3) that what we may call the
ideal strength of the legion was also unchanged. But it would
be a great mistake to su pose that when Caesar had, for ex-
am le, eight legions un er his command, they amounted to
48, 00 men; for his losses were of course considerable. He
tells us (v, 49, ξ 7) that in the fifth year of the Gallie war two
legions, including perha s the 400 cavalry (46, § 4) that accom-
panied them, numbered arely 7‚000. From time to time, how·

ever, his losses were re aired, wholly or in part, by fresh drafts
(vii, 7, § 5 ; 57, ξ 1). ἔθα G. G„ pp. 559-63.
