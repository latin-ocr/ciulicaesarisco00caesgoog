excitabat. Cum a meridie prope ad solis occasum 6
dubia victoria pugnaretur, Germani una in parte
confertis turmis in hostes impetum fecerunt eosque⁴
propulerunt; quibus in fugam coniectis sagittarii 7

partibus nostri cedentes usque ad castra insecuti sui
colligendi facultatem non dederunt. At ii qui Alesia 9
processerant maesti prope victoria desperata se in
oppidum receperunt.

4. ut . . . accedunt. See the note on ii, 19, §6. The force
of ut might be expressed by the following translation t—‘Our
troops moved up to the entrenchments‚ in the places which had
been severally allotted to them beforehand!

fundis lfbn’libus means ‘slings throwin large stones ¹ ς and
Diodorus Siculus (xix, 109,§ 2) says that alearic elingere, who ¹
formed part of Caesar’s army (B. 0., ii, 7, ξ 1), used to sling
stones weighing a mina (about 15 ounces) each. But if we were
to put a comma after fundis, as Meusel does, librilibus would of
course be a noun, and would mean ‘stones as thick as a man’s
arm ’, which were thrown by hand (0. G„ p. 813). Obviously
they would have hit much harder if they had been slung.
