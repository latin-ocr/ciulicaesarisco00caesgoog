xviii THE CREDIBILITY OF

‘the gist of what was said. Almost the only one which is
at all open to suspicion is the comparatively long speech
in the seventy-seventh chapter of the Seventk Commentary, ,
which he attributes to Critognatus. Departing from his
custom, he wrote this speech in the form of Oratio Recta3
and as there was certainly no shorthand writer present
when Critognatus was speaking, the words were of course
Caesar’s own. But we may reasonably suppose that he
was informed of the drift of Critognatus’s arguments by
some one who had listened to them—perhaps by Vercinge
torix himself—for he made at least 60,000 prisoners after
the fall of Alesia.¹

Serious charges have, however, been brought against ’
the general tone of Caesar’s narrative. 'I‘hey may be
grouped in two classes, according to the motives which
his accusers have imputed to him. These motives are, first, Ἴ
a desire to justify unconstitutional, illegal‚ or unrighteous χ
acts, and secondly, a desire to magnify his own exploits, =
to obtain for himself the credit of certain exploits of his
officere, and to conceal everything that might damage ἵ
his reputation as a general. 1 shall examine in foot⁴notes
those of his statements which 1 believe ιο be either 2
inaccurate or misleading; but in this little book it would
of course be out of place to notice all the charges—m i
even all that are worth noticing—which have been
brought against him 3 and 1 have done so already in two
other workS.² Good judges have accepted the conclusion 1
which 1 reached,—that under close scrutiny nearly all tht
charges break down. As an acute critic has remarked,
Caesar took pains to justify his first two campaigns- ἢ
those which he conducted against the Helvetii and ᾗ
Ariovistus—because in crossing the frontier of the Roman r
Province he had acted without the sanction of the Senate:
but he knew that if he could convince his readers that he
had done right in 58 Β. 0., 811 would be well, for the other
