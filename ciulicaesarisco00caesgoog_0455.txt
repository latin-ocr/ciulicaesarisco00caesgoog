COMMENTARIUS VIII 363

mumque imperfectum ab rebus gestis Alexandriae
confeci usque ad exitum non quidem civilis dissensio-
nis, cuius finem nullum videmus, sed vitae Caesaris.

Quos utinam qui legent scire possint quam invitus 3
5 susceperim scribendos quo facilius caream stultitiae
atque arrogantiae crimine, qui me mediis interpo-
suerim Caesaris scriptis. Constat enim inter omnes 4
nihil tam operose ab aliis esse perfectum quod non
horum elegantia commentariorum superetur. Qui 5
10 sunt editi, ne scientia tantarum rerum scriptoribus
deesset, adeoque probantur omnium iudicio ut prae-
repta, non praebita facultas scriptoribus videatur.
Cuius tamen rei maior nostra quam reliquorum est 6
admirati03 ceteri enim quam bene atque emendate,
15 nos etiam quam facile atque celeriter eos perfecerit
scimus. Erat autem in Caesare cum facultas atque 7
elegantia summa scribendi, tum verissima scientia
suorum consiliorum explicandorum. Mihi ne illud 8
quidem accidit, ut Alexandrino atque Africano bello
20 interessem3 quae bella quamquam ex parte- nobis
Caesaris sermone sunt nota, tamen aliter audimus ea
quae rerum novitate aut admiratione nos capiunt,

Gallie War and the Fit-st Commentary on the civil War; while
novissimum denotes the third and last of the commentar-ies on
the Civil War, which breaks off in the middle of the description
os the events that led up to the Alexandrine war, and is therc-
sore called imfflnsecmm.

rebus yestis Alexandriae. The Alexandrine war, in which
Caesar was involved after he had defeated Pompey in the battle
of Pharsalia, was described in the book called Bellum Alex·
andr-iungi the 9112.1)1thor of which was most probably Hirtius
( civilis dissegsionis . . . videmus. Hirtius wrote these words in
44 or early in 43 13.c., for he was killed in the battle of Mutina,
which took place on April 27 of that year. The civilis dissensio
was not terminated until Augustus gained the victory in the
battle of Actium (29 Β.ο.).

ξ 8. A fricano bello. In this war, which took place in 46 Β. C„
Caesar was opposed by Cato, Scipi0‚ Labienus, and the two sons
of Pompey‚ who were supported by the Numidian king, Juba.
The deciswe event was the victory of Caesar at Thapsus, on the
coast about 15 miles south-cast of Monastir. The campaign is
described in an anonymous book called Bellum Africanum.
