COMMENTARIUS VII 313

iam aliter sentire uno colle ab Romanis occupato si
alterum amisissent, quin paene circumvallati atque
omni exitu et pabulatione interclusi viderentur. Ad 5
hunc muniendum locum omnes a Vercingetorige

5 evocatos.

Hac re cognita Caesar mittit complures equitum “and de-

turmas eo de media nocte 3 imperat ut paulo tumul- {gmom

tuosius omnibus locis pervagentur. Prima luce ma· 2
gnum numerum impedimentorum ex castris mulorum-
ιο que produci deque his stramenta detrahi mulionesque
cum cassidibus equitum specie ac simulatione collibus
circumvehi iubet. His paucos addit equites, qui latius 3
ostentationis causa vagentur. Longo circuitu easdem
omnes iubet petere regiones. Haec procul ex oppido 4
15 videbantur, ut erat a Gergovia despectus in castra,
neque tanto spatio certi quid esset explorari poterat.

and huic should be emphasized, but that the emphasis of huic
is nullified by placing 1t aster rehementer: on the other hand,
in β, which rightly gives rominence to huic, the emphasis
of vehementer is weakened y lplacing the word before illos.
Accordingly he conjectures, per aps rightly, that Caesar wrote
huic illos loco vehementer timere.

fortifled and which commanded the western ap roach (where
alone the ascent was practicable) to the saddle t at connected
the heights of Risolles with the plateau of Gergovia, is marked
on the lan facing p. 305.

§ 2. impedimentorum. If Caesar wrote this, and not, as Ciacco·
nius conjectured, iumentorum, the word here can only mean
‘baggage·cattle ' cf. ii, 29, ξ 4); and it has this meanin in
Frontinus, ii, 1, ll. Schneider thinks that Caesar ded
mulorumque to explain what kind of baggage-cattle he meant,
just as in ii, 19, ξ 1 he wrote ratio ordoque agminis. Other
editors suppose that impedimentorum means ‘ pach-horsea ⁹.

collibus. These hills must have been the lower slopes of the
Montagne de la Serre, south of the Auzon. The only other
hills with which collibus could conceivably be identified are the
lower southern slopes of the mountain of Gergovia3 but if
the cavalry had moved along them, how could Caesar have said
(ξ 4) that although ‘ these movements could be seen, far off,
from the town . . . it was impossible, at such a distance, to make
out exactly what they meant ² (G. G„ p. 760) ⁴?

Vercingetorix was fortifying.
