120 DE BELLO GALLICO

the Gauls, in vii, 20, {5 he makes Vercingetorix speak of their
animi mollities with t e same meaning.

20, ξ 1. After hominum the MSS. have ex tertia ne, which
Lipsius proposed to replace by est tertia pars: H. leist for an
obvious reason altered this into tertia pars . . . est. Τὴο first
pars, et reqionum . . . hominum, and aestimanda are bracketed
gy Meusel (J. Β., 1910, pp. 32—3) and Klotz (C'.S., pp. 34-5).

heir chief reasons are that Caesar could not have written

pars . . . ex tertia parte . . . est, διας that ex tertia parte
Galliae est aestimanda) is an unclassical expression; that the
statement could only have applied to Aquitania as it was in
the time of Augustus, when the province of Aquitania extended
beyond the Garonne as far as the Loire3 and that in i, 1, 1
(or § 7), to which the words ut ante dictum est evidently re er,
the same statement is not to be found. Dr. Rutherford, indeed
(Gallio War, II and III, p. 91), defends the passage, remark-
ing that ‘ex has the same meaning here as in haer-es ex
asse’, and accordingly he translates by ‘ which district . . . by
reason both of its extent and population, ought to be regarded
as a third division of Gaul ; but the words seem to me
suspicions. Vielhaber brackets the whole passage quae ars . . .
aestimanda: but if we were to follow his example, we s ould be
confronted with the awkwardness of two successive clauses each
beginning with oum; and if we accept Meusel's reading, we
must admit that the statement quae, ut ante dictum est, teriia
pars Galliae est is hardly worth makin .

L. Valerius Praeconinus and L. anlius were defeated in
78 13. ο. in the war with Sertorius, a famous Roman general,
belongin to the party of Mariua who, supported b native
allisa, he d his und for many years in Spain against {ietellus
and Pompey. ut the reader must not e satisfied with this
note, which is only a kind of sign-post. If he wants to make
the acquaintance of Sertorius, who is worth knowing‚ he must
read Roman history.

raised in the country of the Nitiobroges, immediately north
of Aquitania, who were very strong in cavalry, and were then
