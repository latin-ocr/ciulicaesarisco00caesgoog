early period there was intercourse between the two.
Britain, like Gaul, had its Stone Age, its Bronze Age,
its Early Iron Age. Its earlier inhabitante, like those of
Gaul, were conquered by Celts, the latest bordes of whom
were Belgae. Druidism flourished in Britain: the Britons
worshipped gods who were also Gallic; and we have seen

but four hundred for each legion was near the average.

soldiers. Each legion consisted of ten cohorts; and the
cohort, formed of three maniples or six centuries, had

From the earliest times the legion had been commanded
