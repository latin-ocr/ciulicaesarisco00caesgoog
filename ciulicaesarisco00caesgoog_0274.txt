ξ 3. mefixe'd e . Qua which is omitted in φ, is certainly an
interpolation.. eusel says (J. B„ 1910, pp. 68-9), if Caesar
had written 1t‚ acutis would have to be taken as a participle;
but in classical Latin it is always an adjective.

ἐξ 4-5. His rebus coynih‘s . . . mandat-ent. This excessively
laconio passage seems at first sight hard to explain. What
happened was probably this. The cavalry were sent behind
cover to swim the river close by, where it was not obstructed
by stakes; and at the right moment the infantry plun d into
the water and advanced to the attach. Caesar had ca culated
that the Britons would be disti-acted by the onset of the cavalry
upon their flanks and rear3 but the infantry were determined
to have the credit for themselves. We may suppose that, while
they were removing the stakes or sawin off their points, the
slingers and archers (see p. lxiii audii, 7, ξῗ) harassed the enemy.
It has been objected that praemisso ‘ must mean that Caesar
sent the cavalry across the river, orderin the infantryto follow
kimmediately behind] them '. But suc an operation would

ave been absolutely impossible: the word Sed proves that the
infantry in their ardour crossed before the cavalry could charge ;
and praemisso simply means that when Caesar was approachmg

Cassive launus had 4,000 chariots, or 2,000 charioteers with
2,000 warrior-s (see iv, 33, §§ 1-2) ⁴? I adopt the former ex·
planati0n3 but I am not qu1te sure (A. B., p. 675).
