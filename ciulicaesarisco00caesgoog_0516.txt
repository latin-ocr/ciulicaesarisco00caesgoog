p. 562, n. 3). Anyhow Gaesar's account of his voyage (v, 8, ἕξ 2-4)
proves that his statement was not far wrong. It is clear, then,
that we need not look for Portus Itius south of Boulogne oreast
of Calais. Calais is out of the question : it was not a port at all
in Caesar's time, indeed it was not even mentioned before the
twelfth century, and to sail from it to any place in England
with a south-west wind (8, ξ 2) would have been impossible.
Ambleteuse and Sangatte may also be rejected: the formet-was
a tiny port, in which Caesar's huge fleet could not have found
room; the* latter had no recommendation at all. Only two
{laces remain,—Boulogne and wissant, which is between Cape

lanc-Nez and Ga e Gris·Nez. Itis now generally believed that
Portus Itius was oulogne. But without excavating for traces
of Gaesar's camps it is not ossible to do more than show that
this opinion is highly proba le.

It is certain that the harbour from which Caesa sailed in
55 13. o. was Boulo ne. 'this has been proved in Ancient Britain
(pp. 558, 581—2, 5 8), and the argument is summarized in the
note on iv, 22, ξ 4. It is there shown by the unanimous
testimony of nautical experts that if Caesar had sailed from
any other port, his cavalry transports which, after they were

Commenta& and the former of the two passages in which he
mentions it in the Fifth (2, ξ 3) might suggest that in 54 Β. e.
he used it for the first time. For he tells us that he ‘ordered
all the ships to assemble at the Itian harbour, from which
he had ascertained that the passage to Britain was most
convenient ¹. Certainly these words do not rove that he had
not sailed from the Itian harbour in 553 but tfiey might.suggest
that he had since found that it would be better to use a new
harbour, as his fleet was now eight times as numerous as it had
been in the previous year. Now there is not the slightest
doubt that even in 54 Boulogne was in most respecta by far the
most convenient port for his purpose. It was then considerably

connected by roads with the interior, and therefore the supplies
which he needed for his army could easily have been trans-
ported to it. The country near it is fertile, whereas the
country ‘near Wissant is barren. Ships could have been built
at Boulogne, but not at Wissant, where there could have been
no dockyards: therefore if Portus Itius was Wissant, Labienus,
who was left by Caesar in charge of ‘the ports ² (8, 1),.must
have ordered the sixty ships which were built while aesal- was
in Britain (23, ξ 4) .to be built at Boulogne. Lastly, Caesar
could have sailed to Britain with a south-west wind more
conveniently from Boulogne than from Wissant. But Boulogne
