evidence for fixi their whereabouts (Ο. G„ pp. 454-5).

Narbo is nownlffarbonne.

Nemaea—'Phe Nemetes are mentioned by Caesar (i, 51, §2)
amon the tribes who fought in the army of Ariovistus; and he
says t at the entire army of Ariovistus took part in the campmqn
(38, ξ 1), and that the few individuale who survived the batt e
and the retreat recrossed the Rhine (53, ξς 1-2). If these
statements were accurate, the Nemetes who were settled on the
left bank round Spires in the time of Pliny (Nat. Hist„ iv, 17,
ξ 106) must have been immi nte, descended from a ortion of
the tribe which had not foffiwed Ariovistus into aul; but
when Caesar wrote that Ariovistus had taken the field cum suis
omnibus 'is (i, 38, δ 1) he may onl have meant ‘with all his
[available forces ’. Ἰιι that case, owever‚ we should have

I have not marked the Nemetes on the mal), because Ι only
profess to represent Gaul as it was in the time of Gaesar; and
we do not know exactly what territory was occupied by the
Nemetes before the defeat of Ariovistus (C. G„ pp. 455-6).

Nemetocenna was identical with Nemetacum (Ptolemy,
Geggvg), ii, 9, ξ 4), which stood upon the site of Artas (C'. G„

of the Demer and the D’yle, ast Flanders, and part of the
province of Antwerp. Perhaps it extended as far northward
as the estuary of the Scheldt; sor Caesar (ii, 28, ξ 1) says
that the Nervii, before encountering him in 57 13.c., sent
their non-combatants for safetv in aestuaria, which can only
mean the low-lying tracte bordei-ing that estuary. But it is
not ἓξέιξιῖῗι that the aestuaria were ιιι Nervian territory (0. G„
pp'Phe geographical positione of the dependants of the Nervii—
the Ceutrones, Geidumni‚ Grudii‚ Levaci, and Pleumoxii—are
unknown. Various attempts have been made to fix them ς but
there is no evidence except doubtful resemblance of names,—

( Niiig roges.-)—The Nitiobroges possessed the diocese of
Agen (Aginnum) and perhaps also that of Cond0m‚ which
was o inally included in it,-that is to say, the greater part
of the epartment of the Lot-etGaronne and a small fraction
of the department of the Tam-efflaronne. It is doubtful,
however, whether they had any territory south of the Garonne3
for the Bituriges Vivisci possessed lands on its left bank, and
therefore if the river in its central course did not separate the
Celtae from the Aquitani, it did so nowhere, and Caesar's
statement in i, 1, ξ 2 was inaccurate. But, as 1 have already
