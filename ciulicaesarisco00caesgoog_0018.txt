xii THE TEXT OF THE COMMENTARIES

abbreviation, he meant aliter, ‘otherwise '. He wished to
show that besides uxellodunum there was another spelling,
uxillodunum. This manuscript passed into the hands
of a copyist who misunderstood the abbreviation α. and
wrote auoeillo dunum, and as l might easily be mistaken
for· i, somebody else wrote auxilio dunum.

A great many manuscripts of Caesar exist3 but only
nine or ten of them are now considered good. They are
divided into two groups‚ known as α and β, and generally
believed to be derived from a common original, or arche·
type, which is called X. Each manuscript is called by
a letter, which is here prefixed to the full name :—

A = codex Bongarsianus (or Amstelodamensis 81) of the
ninth or tenth century.

Β = Parisinus 1 (Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, 5763,
ninth or tenth century).

M = Vaticanus (vatican, 3864, tenth century). ¹

Q = Moysiacensis (PariS‚ Bibl. nat„ 5056, twelfth cen· ¹
tury). l

S = Ashburnhamianus (Bibl. Laurent. R. 33, tenth ¹
century). 1

a = Parisinus II or 'I‘huaneus (Paris, Bibl. nat„ 5764,
eleventh century).

f = Vindobonensis 1(Bib1.Vind0b. [Vienna], 95, twelsth
century).

h = Ursinianus (Vatican‚ 3324, eleventh century).

l = Riccardianus (Bibl. Riccard. [Florence]‚ 541, eleventh
or twelfth century).

To φ may be added the best manuscript in the British
Museum (Add. MSS. 10,084)‚ which is known as Lova-
niensis and referred to as L. I have published a colla-
tion of this manuscript in the Classical Qum-terly of J uly,
1911, and Meusel has estimated its value in Jahresbeffchte
des phizozoqischen Vereins zu Berlin, 1912, pp. 15-18.
