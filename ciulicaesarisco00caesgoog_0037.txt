THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL xxxi

appear to show that they were not what they professed to
be. Strabo says that the Nervii were Germane ; but the
names of Nervian and Treveran individuale, as well as
the geographical names of both tribes, were Celtic. So
also were the names of the Eburones and their two kings,
—Ambiorix and Catuvolcus. Hirtius, the author of the
Eiyhth Commentary, while he notes the resemblance of
the Treveri to the Germans in manners and customs, says
that it was due to the fact that the Treveri were neigh-
bours of the GermanS.¹ Perhaps there were Celticized
Germans among the Nervii and the Treveri3 but unless
we know what the Roman ambassadors meant by the
word Germani, their statement that the Belgae ‘ were of
German origin ’ proves nothing3 and it would be very
rash to assume that they meant a Teutonic people who
spoke a Teutonic language. My own belief is that they
only meant that the Belgae were descendants of a people
who had once dwelt on the east of the Rhine.

But what of the five tribes—the Eburones„ Caerosi,
Paemani, Segni, and Condrusi—whom Caesar himself
calls Germans? A famous scholar, Karl Mullenhoff,
argues that they too were Celts3 for, he observeS, their
tribal names, the names of individuale among them-
Ambiorix and Catuvolcus—and the ancient names of
rivers and places within their territory are Celtic. This
is true; but it does not settle the question. 'rho preva-
lence of Celtic names might be accounted for by supposing
that German invaders had mingled with an older Celtic
population. Celtic place-names existed in Germany long
after the time of Caesar, and this proves that people who
spoke Celtic once lived in Germany; but at the time
of the conquest of Gaul, if any Celts remained in
Germany, they had been absorbed in the German popu·
lation. Kent is a Celtic name; but that does not prove
that the present inhabitants of Kent are Celts. Still,
I believe that in the main Mullenhoff was right. Pro·
bably the Reman ambassadors or Caesar's informante,
whoever they were, only meant that these five tribes,
like the other Belgae, were descended from people who
