330 DE BELLO GALLIOO

incerto etiam nune exitu victoriae, cum VII. legionis
tribunis esset nuntiatum quae in sinistro cornu gere-
rentur, post tergum hostium legionem ostenderunt
7 signaque intulerunt. Ne eo quidem tempore quis-
quam loco cessit, sed circumventi omnes interfectique ⁵
8 sunt. Eandem fortunam tulit Camulogenus. At ii
qui in praesidio contra castra Labieni erant relicti.
eum proelium commissum audissent, subsidio suis
ierunt collemque ceperunt neque nostrorum militum
9 victorum impetum sustinere potuerunt. Sic cum suis 1ο i
fugientibus permixti, quos non silvae montesque ¹
10 texerunt, ab equitatu sunt interfecti. Hoc negotio
confecto Labienus revertitur Agedincum, ubi impedi·
menta- totius exercitus relicta erant3 inde cum omni-
bus copiis ad Caesarem pervenit. 15

ξ 8. in praesidio (see the note on vi, 33, ξ 4) here means
‘ as a guard ’ (though Caesar generally expresses this by the
dative), that is ‘ on guard '. The words can hardly be equivalent
to in loco munito, for the Gauls would not have fortified a position

( esst 5¹³1. 0oqmia. Meusel (J. 3., 1910, p. 71) mys that the
next two sentences show what the Aedui themselves did in order
to weaken the position of the Romans, and that if cognita had
been written by Caesar, he would have said in the following
sentences that other peoples‚ on hearing of the defection of the
Aedui, had 'oined the rebellion. There is force in this arg-u-
ment; but think nevertheless that Caesar might legitimately ¹
have begun the chapter by remarking that ‘ When the defection
of the Aedui became known, the gravity of the war merea-sed ’. 1

§ 2. nituntur is defended by O. Schneider on the ground that
the construction of nitor with ad occurs in Bell. Ala„ 20, ξ 6;
but R. Schneider (Β. ph. W„ 1886, p. 982) may be right in con·
jecturing that Caesar wrote utuntur.

ξ 3. supplicio evidently means either ⁴ by the threat of punish·
