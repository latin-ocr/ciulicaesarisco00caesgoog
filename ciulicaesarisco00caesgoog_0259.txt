COMMENTARIUS V 177

que imperat; si vim faciat neque pareat, interfici 7
iubet, nihil hunc se absente pro sano facturum arbi-
tratus qui praesentis imperium neglexisset. Ille enim 8

liberaeque esse civitatis Illi, ut erat imperatum, 9

Haedui ad Gaesarem omnes revertuntur.

ξὸ. binim. Not without hesitation I retain the MS. reading
instead of autem, which occurs in an inferior MS. and in the
first printed edition of the Commentarios. In several passages
some MSS. have autem, others enim. Some editors explain
enim by an ellipsis; and the following translation of nihil . . .
vesistere will show what they mean :—‘ for he thought that a
man who disregarded his authority when he was present would
not behave rationally in his absence. [And he was right in so
thinking ;] for when called u on to return he resisted’, διο.
Sometimes, however, as Schnei er points out, em'm means much
the same as scilicet, and so here it would bc equivalent to ‘as
might have been expected ' (from what has been said before
about his character). But connecting particles are often used
in Greek and Latin when a good Enghsh writer would use none ;
and the best way of translating em‘m (or autem) here would be
to i ore it.

§gg hominem. 'I'he word here shows animosity, while in

(iv, 22, ξ 4), Caesar found it convenient to keep more than
one harbour under control.

δ’ 2. Africo must be translated by ‘ south-west wind ’, and is so
called because it was the most favoni-able wind for ships sailing
from Carthago to Sicily. It may have blown from any point
between SW. and W. by S. , S. See the second note on 7, ξ 3.

aestu. Caesar was carrie out of his course (delatus) by the
flood tide, the general direction of which was ENE. On the
