xxx THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL

of Brittany. The mople who spoke this language are
called ‘P Celts ⁹, because they had changed the original
sound qu into p. Thus the original form of Parisii would
have been Qarisii. The same change took place in other
languages3 for instance, the Greek equivalent of equus is
ἵππος. But there is some reason to believe that in cer·
tain parts of Gaul a Celtic dialect was spoken in which
the sound qu was retained. This dialect is called Goidelic‚
and it was the ancestor of Gaelic, which is still spoken in
the western parts of Ireland and in the highlands of
Scotland. Those who believe that it was spoken in Gaul
in Caesar’s time point to the words Sequana and Sequani,
the ancient name of the river Seine and the name of the
tribe whose chief town was Vesontio (Besancon). But
some Celtic scholare believe that these names were not
Celtic, but Ligurian,—a language of which we know
hardly anything. All that we can be sure of is that if
a Goidelic dialect had been spoken by the earlier Celtic
invaders, it had been superseded, except perhaps in cer-
tain districts, by Gallo-Brythonic. The Belgae, then,
and the Celtae spoke the same language3 their physical
features are described by ancient writers in terms which
are virtually identical ; and they were closely related in
blood and had a common civilization.

But we must not forget that Caesar says that, accord-
ing to the ambassadors who came to him from the Remi,
‘ most of the Belgae were of German origin ' (plerosque
Belyas esse ortos a Germanis ¹). He does not, however,
endorse the statement of the ambassadors ; and the fact
that he himself, rightly or wrongly, specifies five Belgic
tribes—the Eburones, Caerosi, Paemani, Segni, and Con-
drusi—as German‚² perhaps implies that he had reason
to believe that the rest of the Belgae were not. Tacitus ³
regards only the Triboci, the Nemetes, and the Vangiones
as ‘undoubtedly German tribes’ (haud dubie Germanorum
populi); and none of the three were Belgae at all. The
Treveri (who were Celtae, not Belgae) and the Nervii,
according to Tacitus, wished to be considered Germans ;
but, if he was rightly informed, this very fact would
