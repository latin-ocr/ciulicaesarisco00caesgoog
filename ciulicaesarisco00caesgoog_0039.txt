THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL xxxiii

the most blonde representatives of it, is strikingly different
from that of the purest representatives of the ancient
GermanS. Put a Perthshire Highlander side by side
with a Sussex farmer. Both will be fair: but the red
hair and beard of the Scotsman will be in marked con·
trast with the fair hair of the Englishman; and their
features will differ still more. Ι remember seeing two
gamekeepers in a railway carriage running from Inverness
to Laii-g. They were tall, athletic, fair rnen, evidently
belonging to the Scandinavian type which is so common
in the extreme north of Scotland ; but they were utterly
different from the tall fair Highlanders whom Ι had seen
in Perthshire. There was not a trace of red in their
hair, their long beards being absolutely yellow. The
prevalence of red among the Celtic-speaking peoples is
most remarkable. Not only do we find in Perthshire
11 men in every 100 whose hair is absolutely red, but
underlying the blacks and the dark browns the same
tint is everywhere to be discerned. In France, again, the
proportion of red-haired individuale is greatest not in
Normandy or the north-eastern departments‚ where the
proportion of German immigrants was greatest, but in
Finistere‚ where many of the Celtic invaders from Britain
lauded. I think that what I have said is enough to
establish at least a probability that the Oelts and the
Germane, notwithstanding their general resemblance,
differed from one another; and some years ago the late
Dr. Beddoe, a renowned anthropologist, told me that he
was strongly inclined to adhere to my view. But after
all the most that Ι have succeeded in proving is that th
Celts had become different from the Germana some cen-
turies after they had parted from them; and what we
want to learn is whether any difference had arisen when
they first entered Gaul. The tall Gaul and the tall
German were undoubtedly descended from a common
fair-haired stock; and it is very likely that in so far
as the Oelts of Gaul differed in ansar’s time from the
Germans, the difference was due to intermarriage with
Ligurians and dark descendants of the prehistoric races.
