240 DE BELLO GALLICO

5 eos honore. Nam fere de omnibus controversiis
publicis privatisque constituunt, et si quod est facinus
admissum, si caedes facta, si de hereditate, de finibus
controversia est, idem decernunt, praemia poenasque

6 constituunt3 si qui aut privatus aut populus eorum Ι
decreto non stetit, sacrificiis interdicunt. Haec poena

7 apud eos est gravissima. Quibus ita est interdictum,
hi numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habentur, his
omnes decedunt, aditum eorum sermonemque defu-
giunt, ne quid ex contagione incommodi accipiant, 10
neque iis petentibus ius redditur neque honos ullus

,ξ 5. finibm. M. d’Arbois de J ubainville maintained that
fines here meant the frontiers of states; but Caesar, while pro-
fessing to tell us in what respecta the customs of the Germane
differed from those of the GauIS, says expressly (22. ξ 2) that
the former did not reco ‘ze private property in land3 and,
taken in conjunction wit that passage, the words si (infinibus
controversia est imply that the Gauls did. Resides, Caesar re·
marks (22, ἐξ 2-4, with which cf. iv, i, ξ 7) that the Germane
refused to sanction private property in land ‘ in order to prevent
the growth of avarice’ (ne qua oriatur pecuniae cupiditas) and
‘to keep the messes contented ’ (ut animi aequitate con·
tineam), neither of which objecta was attained in ul: it is
inconeeivable that a people who had a coinage, a wealthmlaqs,
and an extensive commerce should have he d all theu· d in
common3 and nobody will believe that Ambiorix was not the
owner of the land which surrounded his country house (30, ξ 3),
that Lucterius owned no land though a fortified town formed
part of his clientela (viii, 32, ξ 2), or that the governments of
the various Gallio states would have been as weak aa they were
(i, 4, ξ 2; 17, 1 ; 18, § 33 vii, 4, ξ 4) if they had controlled
cultivation an disposed of the crops (0. G„ pp. 509-12).

M. Jullian (H. G„ ii, 99, n. 6), w1th whom I agree, holds that
poenas denotes fue penalties infficted for non-payment. Cf.
A. B„ . 294, n. .
