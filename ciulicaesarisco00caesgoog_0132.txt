C. Valerius Flaccus was Governor of the Province in 83 Β. e.
Towards the end of the Roman Republic‚ after Roman citizen-
ship had been conferred, as a result of the Social war, u n all
the free population of Italy, eminent men had been aut orized
to confer the civitas upon deserving forei ners; and Caesar
exercised this privilege on his own respons1 ility. See Cicer0‚

48, § 1. sub monte consedit. These words are very important,
for, if they do not enable us to identify the site of the battle
between Caesar and Ariovistus (51-2), they greatly nan-ow the
choice and condemn nearly all the attempts that have been
made to determine the topography of the campaign. The

reat majority of these guesses are irreconcilable either with
gaesar’s statement (41, § 4) that the circuitous part of his march
from Besancon was more than fifty Roman miles long, or with
the statement that his interview with Ariovistus took lace in

past Caesar's camp, at the foot of a mountain. The only theories
which we need examine are those of Colonel Stoffel and M. J ullian.

'Phe words sub monte consedit, as Stoffel remarks, show wh
Caesar did not attack Ariovistus while he was making the flan
march which is described in 48, 2. They prove that he
marched alon high round,where t e Romans could not attack
him without eavy oss: for Caesar, who was economical of
words, would not have told us that Ariovistus encamped at the
foot of a mountain unless the statement had been essentia] to
his narrative: nor would it have been essential unless it had im-
plied that Ariovistus, after encamping there, ascended the slopes
in order to execute his march without the risk of being attacked.

According to Stoffel,Caesar marched from Vesontio (Besaneon)
at the rate of about sixteen miles a day, and encamped at the
end of his seven days’ march (41, ξ 5) on the left bank of the
Fecht, between Ostheim and Gemar: the tumulus temnus satis
⁸orandis (43, ξ 1) was the ‘tertre de Plettig’; Ariovistus made
his flank march on the lower slopes of the Vosges between the
defiles of the Weiss and the Strengbach · and Caesar made the
smaller camp which he mentions in 46, ἓξ 1-2 on a spur of
the Vosges between Bebelnheim and Mitte weler. The ‘ tertre
de Plettig’ is the only knoll which answers to Caesar's descrip-
tion ; therefore. unless the tumulus was artificial (see the
note on 43, ξ 1), this fact settles the question in favour of
