23,§ l. solvit (naves) means ‘loosed’ (the ships from their
fastemngs) and generall connotes the operation of letting go
a hawser and putting o from shore or quay.

ξ 2. Α quibus is bracketed by Mommsen (J. Β., 1894, p. 204)
on the ground that the following narrative shows that as the

rimae naves which ‘reached Britain about the fourth hour'

elonged to the principal fleet, the cavalry did not arrive paulo
tardius, but not at all. Mommsen must have been dreaming.
In 26, ξ 5 we read that ‘ the cavalry had not been able to kee
their course and make the island '‚-—evidently because they hag
been late in starting and had therefore encountered an un·
favourable wind; and they were late in starting because, as
Caesar says, ‘ they were rather dilatory in getting through their
work! Resides, what becomes of ipse without Α quibus ‘z’

omnibus cellmua—the cliffs between Dover and the South

Foreland‚ which, seen from the sea, look like a series of heights
separated by well-defined de ressions. 'l'he Britons were evi·
dently prepared to defend over harbour if Caesar should
attempt to and there. There was then a small natural harbour
at Dover (A.B.‚ p. 530-1).

ξ 3. αηφιιειίε. fieusel (J. B„ 1910, pp.69-70) brackets this word,
which has occasioned much dlscussion. ‘What’, he aske, ‘are

that montibus anqustis could only mean ⁴ limiting' or ‘ confinin ⁹
mountains, and in the Golden Age of Latin literature could only
have been written by a poet. Is this quite certam, seemg that
there are many words which Caesar uses only once ⁴? Heller
(Ph. Suppl.. v, 1889, p. 385), referring to Ovid's Metamorphoses,
v, 410 (Quod coit unqu-stis inclusum cornibus aequor, where
anqustis cornibus means hills separated by a nan-ow fiord),
maintains that mon-tibus unque-tis means hills qm· anyustum inter
