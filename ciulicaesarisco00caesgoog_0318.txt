§ 4. venerint . . . coepissent. Sec the first note on v, 27, ξ 4. 1
Meusel observes (J. Β., 1894, p.365) that Caesar might well have
written venerint . . . coegerint or venissent . . . ooeyiseent, but that
he wrote venerint under the influence of the present, oesemnt,
and coeyissent under the influence of the following perfect
infinitive‚ recepisse. 1 believe that he wrote vener-int because
it describes a more recent act than coeyissent. In Oratio Recta
he would have written venerunt . . . coeyemnt.

ξ 5. appellatur. Meusel (J. Β., 1894, pp. 381-2) insiste that
Caesar wrote appelletur: for he would not have suddenly intro·
duced a statement of his own in the middle of the repert
furnished by the scouts ; he could only have learned the name
of the forest from them ; and he would not have made a remark
which might create the impression that he was parading his
geographical knowledge. Perhaps he did write appelletur: but
the question is whether the text can be reasonably defended3
and Ι think that ii, 4, ξ 10 answers Meusel’s arguments.

Suebis . . . prohibere. Meusel adopts an emendation pro
by ciacconius,—(Cheruscos ab) Sueborum (Suebosque ab)—
Cheruscorum, &c.; but I do not a ree with him that the MS.
reading is untranslatable. Still, e construction is very harsh
and unusual; and perhaps, as he suggests (J. Β., 1894, p. 286),
the words Suebosque . . . incursionibueqsoe, which might well be
dispensed with, were interpolated.

11, § 2. payis. See p. hv.

partibusque is suspicions. Meusel remarks (J. Β., 1910, p. 66)
that the civitates, payi, and domus were also partes Galliae, and
that one may infer from i. 12, ξ 4, where π has panes vel papo:
instead ofpaqoS, that panibus was added to explain payis.

ξ 3. eorum is equivalent to Gallorum: the antecedent os
