COMMENTARIUS VII 325

incolumem exercitum traduxit, frumentumque in agris 5

iter in Senones facere instituit.

tato . . . ut metu idam existimabant,-—‘as some under the
influence of sear t ought ' §that ‚it would be necessary to
do), διο. The general sense o this is identical with that of the
emendation which 1 have adopted: and 1 believe that one or
the other hits the mark (0. 0., pp. 771-4).

ξ 4. vadoque . . . invento. Caesar crossed the Allier three days
aster he 10st Gergovia (53, ξ 4): therefore we may be sure that
he did not eroes it at any pomt nearer than Vichy. After he
had cromed, Eporedorix and Viridomarus lest him, hurried off
to Noviodunum, and burned it. Noviodunum is not more than
70 miles, in a straight line, from Vichy3 and Caesar was not
standing still while Eporedorix and Viridomarus were ridin
thither. Not until he heard that they had burned the town di
he determine to hurry; and he did not reach the Loire until he
had made ⁴ forced marches by day and night ’. We must
therefore look for the ford as far from Vichy as possible in the
direction in which he was marching to rejoin Labienus. Most
probably it was close to Noviodunum (C. 0., p. 774).

disposito . . . nst-inqem. I am inclined to infer from
B.G., i 64, §§ 5-6 that the cavalry may have been formed
in two fines, one above the infantry, the other below, to rescue
any soldiers who might be carried off their feet.

Luteciam . . . Sequamu. This little Gallie town· the nucleus
of Paris- was situated on the island in the Seine on which now
stands· the cathedral of Notre-Dame.
