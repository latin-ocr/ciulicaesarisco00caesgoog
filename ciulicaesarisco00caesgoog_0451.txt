COMMENTARIUS VII 359

aggeres neque fossae vim hostium sustinere poterant,

coactis XI cohortibus, quas ex proximis praesidiis

I. The MSS. differ. BLM have uua XL; ΑΟ have una
de XL 39); and β has de XL, which is nonsense. It is not
easy to elieve that Labienus would have been able to withdraw
39 or 40 cohorte—two-fifths of the'whole army—from the nearest
redoubts. 1 therefore doubtfully adopt Ciacconius's conjecture.

words, remarking that every child in Rome knew that the
general wore a paludamentum in action, and W. Paul ints
out, hypercritically in my opinion, that the words re er to
vestitus, not, as one would have expected, to colom. Schneider,
on the other hand, argues that Caesar made the remark in
question because, unhke some commandere—for example
Q. Caecilius Metellus Scipio (Bell. Afra, 57, ξ 5), who wore the
cloak habitually in campaigns—he only donned it in action.

Mont Rea, on which Labienus was standing: the declivia et
devexa were the slopes of the hill of Flavigny.

ξ 3. I prefer omissis (a) to emissis (β), partly because it accords
better with yladiv‘e rem yet-unt, partly because the enemy were
already at close quai-tere (87, ξ 5). Cf. Sallust's Catiline, 60, §Q—

ξ 4. As dux here of course means ‘military commander'‚

prInceps evidently means ‘ chief magistrate ’ (C'. G„ p. 533, n. 2).
