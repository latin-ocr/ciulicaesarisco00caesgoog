xxvi THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL

to the mixed population called Celtae first enter Gaul?
Did they introduce the language which we call Celtic, or
was it spoken in Gaul before they arrived ’ἓ Did they all
speak the same language? Were they kinsmen of the
Belgae, and did the Celtae and the Belgae speak the same
language? Were any of the Belgio tribes German ⁴? were
the Celtae and the Belgae, when they invaded Gaul,
nearly related to the Germane? Before 1 attempt to
answer these questions Ι will ask the reader to bear in
mind that Caesar uses the word Galli in two senses:
sometimes he means the people between the Seine or the
Marne and the Garonne, sometimes he means both them
and the Belgae.

According to the historical evidence, 1119 first Celtic
invasion of Gaul cannot be dated earlier 11188 1119 seventh
century before Christ; but, as we have already seen, the
tall men whose skeletons have been found in Eastern
Franco in graves of a somewhat older period may have
belonged 10 1119 first group of Celtic invaders If we
may trust Caesar, the Gauls in general, including the
Belgae, were conspicuously tall: ‘the Gauls,’ he says,
‘as a rule, despise our short stature, contrasting it with
their own great height’;¹ and all 1119 ancient writers
who describe the Gauls say much the same, most of them
adding that the Gauls were fair. Now any observant
person who has travelled much in France must have
noticed that tall blonde people are rare, and that, with
comparatively few exceptions, they are only to be seen in
the north-eastern departments‚ where many of the in·

819 we to account for the contrast between modern
Frenchmen and the Gauls whom Caesar and other ancient
writers described ’ἓ Το begin with, we may be sure that
even in Caesar’s day tall fair men formed only a minority
of the population; for, as we have seen, the people who
were in possession when the Celts arrived were for the
most part short and dark, and we may be sure that even
the Celtic invaders were not 811 of the same type: when
untrained observers enter a strange country they notice
