ment ' or ‘by punishin a few '; for if all the hostages had been
killed, the Aedui woul have used up their power of intimidating
waverers.

ξ 4. Haedui is, in Meusel⁸s opinion (J. B„ 1910, p. 63) super·
fluous, for it is the subject of the preceding verbs, tulent, nituntur,
and territant. Schneider, however, defends the word, referring
to i, 14, ξ 1 (legati Helvetii).

communicet means, I believe, ‘concert with them’ (a plan of
campaign), just as in vi, 2,§ 3 Senones . . . cum Carnutibus
finitimisque civitatibus consilia communicare means ‘the Senones
. . . were in communication witli the Carnutes ⁹, διο. On the
other hand, in iv, 13, §4 consilio cum legatis . . . communicato
means that Caesar ‘communicated to his generals . . . his deter-
mination’3 and perhaps Caesar may mean that the Aedui
re uested Vercingetorix to impart to them his own plan.

36. Multitudinis . . . ermittitur. Strabo was perhaps thinking
of this passa e when e wrote {im 4, ξ 3) that Gallie generals
used to be e ected by ‘ the mu titude’ (εἷς πόλεμον εἷς ὑπὸ τοῦ
πλήθους ἀπεδείκνυτο στρατηγός). The multitudo Which Caesar
speaks of here can only have com rised the knights (equites)
who were resent (see vi, 13, ξ ) and perhaps also their
retainers, w o may have accompanied them ; for ιι is obviously
ineredible that the concilium included representatives of the
lower orders, who could not have borne the eost of the journey.
Besides, as Caesar distinctly says (vi, 13, ᾗ l), plebes . . . nulli
adhibetur concilio-

ξ 7. Ab hoc . . . aftcemnt. There were other absentees, whom
Caesar ignores. 'l‘he Aquitanians, who had taken no part in
the war, except sending mercenary cavalry to Teutomatus
(31, ξ 5), were of course not represented3 and 1 am inclined
to infer from certain significant omissione in the list fich. 75) of
the tribes which sent contingents to the relief of A esia that
others were influeneed by the Remi and the Lingones to hold
aloof. It seems unlikely‚ moreover, that the Eburones and the
other ‘Cisrhenane Germane ’ (vi, 2, ξ 3) sent delegates.

toto bello is of course ablative of time3 otherwise Caesar
would have written a tolo bello. cf. vi, 14, ξ 1 and L. C„ i, 45-7.
