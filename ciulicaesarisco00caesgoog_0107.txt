29,§ 1. litteris Graecis. Greek characters were also used by
Druids (vi, 14, ξ 3). Some Gallie inscribed coins have a jumble
of Greek and Roman characters (C. G„ pp. 730-1).

§ 2. Meusel (J. Β., 1910, p. 51)doubts whether Quarum omnium
ret-um is an interpolation or' a corruption. The words seem
sifi-perfluens.. Il* sstey are-genugne, ἓι76γξᾶἱ6 used as the genitive

(J. Β., 1894, p. 275) asks whether Caesar would have been guilty
of such a solecism as equitum numerus ficit Vmilia. He refers
to iv, 15, ξ 3-cum hostium numerus capitum CCCCXXX milium
fuisset—and many similar passages.

§3. Summa . . . CCCLXVIII. A German writer thinks it
sus icious that the original number of the whole host, according
to aesar, was exactly four times the number of the fighting
mem and he concludes that Caesar merely made a rough
estimate, based upon the ascertained number of the men, whose
individual names were recorded (ξ 1). Even so, however, the
whole number could hardly have been less than 300,000; and
some critics have argued that Caesar was guilty of ex eration.
Napoleon ΙΙΙ, who accepted his figures, gave reasons for lieving
that the Helvetii had 8‚500 ons 3 and if so, the length of the
column would have been near y 80 miles, {f the waqons moved in

wagons did not move in single file except when they were
crossing a bridge or passing through a narrow defile (6, ξ l).
Wagons in South Africa have often moved four, or even five,
abreast; and if the reader will think for a minute he will see
that crossing a bridge would simply have caused delay: it
would not have increased the len h of the column by one yard
more than the length of the rid e. Resides, it has been
sug ested by captain G. Veith that t e Helvetii, having eaten
up e greater art of their three months· supply of corn (5, ξ 3)
before the batt e, and havin , moreover, been disheartened by
the defeat of the Tigurini, hag abandoned many of their wagons.
