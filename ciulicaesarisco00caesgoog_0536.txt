remarked in the note on 29, ξ 3, would not have inereased
the length of the train. The emigrante must, however,
have taken some baggage with them,² and they must
have been aeeompanied by their droves of cattle. The
length of the eolumn, then, presente a difficulty whieh, if
not insuperable, is at least serious.

Anyhow, as the reader will have seen, Ι do not believe
that 92000 men started on the expedition. 1f we
were to reduee this number by one-third, we should
probably be nearer the truth. Ι see no reason to dish-nst

that the two arms of the engine were passed through the
skeins of twisted eordage. A bloek, furnished with a hook
which held the bowstring and which was itself held down
by a trigger, could slide up and down in the groove.
When the engine was loaded the block was forced back,

²1 doubt whether captain Veith’ s suggestion—that many wagons
were abandoned (see the note on 29, 5 8)—is admissible. Wagons
were doubtless lost, owing to breakages and the weakness of draught
