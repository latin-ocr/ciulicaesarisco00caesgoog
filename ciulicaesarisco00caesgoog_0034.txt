xxviii THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL

reasserted itself. Except in certain parts of Scotland‚where
the descendants of Scandinavians are numerouS, and in
certain rural districts where the population has remained
comparatively pure, fair people are more or less rare 3 and
darkness is gradually increasing.

It is generally taken for granted that the Celts brought
the language which is called Celtic into Gaul, and that it
gradually became universal except in Aquitania. One or
two well-known writers, however, believe that the Celtic
invaders, when they entered Gaul, spoke German, and
learned Celtic from the people among whom they settled.
Thus Professor Ridgeway, speaking of the British Isles,
but perhaps thinking also of Gaul, argues that even
when ‘ conquerors bring with them some women of their
own race’, they are generally ‘liable to drop their own
language and practically adopt that of the nativos ’ ; and,
remarking that both Gaelic and Welsh are still spoken in
the British Isles‚ he says that it is absurd to suppose that
the earlier inhabitants of Britain became ‘ completely ⁶
Celticized ' in speech in the few centuries that elapsed
between the Celtic invasione and the time of Caesar.
Now it is quite true that in many instances conquerors
have adopted the language of the people whom they eon·
quered; but in these cases the conquerorS‚ besides being
far inferior in number, were also either less civilized or
not much more civilized than the conquered. The Celtic
conquerors of Gaul and Britain did bring with them not
only ‘ some women ’ but all their women ; for this was
the regular practice both of the Celts and of the Germans.¹
The time in which, according to Professor Ridgeway‚ it is
incredible that the Celtic language became dominant in
Britain and in Gaul was considerably longer than that
in which, as he admits, the language of a small minority
of English settlers became dominant in Ireland. Remem-
ber how quickly the language of Rome took root in
Britain? Gaul, and Spain. If we were to suppose that
the Celtic conquerers of Gaul learned Celtic from the
