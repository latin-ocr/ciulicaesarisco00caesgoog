kept a very bad look-out, they must have sent warning to their
comrades the moment they saw the le ’ons ascending the hill.
On the other hand, by capturing the t ree cam s the Romans

if he had then thought it 'ivvise to advance higher up the yslope,
he would have had a fair chance of beating Vercingetorix in
a fl ht under the walls of the town.

Egverything turns upon the meaning of the words consecutus
id quod animo proposuerat and receptui cani iussit. The obvious
meaning of the former is ‘having achieved his purpose': the
latter may either mean ‘ordered a retreat to be sounded ’ or
‘ordered a recall to be sounded'. Now, as we have already
seen, Caesar had not achieved the whole of his purpose: the
question, then, is whether, at the time when he receptui cani
iussit, he had achieved the first step towards the accomplish·
ment of his real object. If so, receptui cani iussit means
‘ordered a recall ιο be sounded ', Caesar-’s intention being
to re-form the legionaries, who had scattered over the campe.

can only suppose that he used the vague expression conmittens
id quod animo proposuerat in the hope that his readers might
credit him with having intended to follow up his trivial succeoe
lt may, however, be said that he had in some measure achieved
his purpose 3 for it was better to try and fail than to sn eak away
without trying at all (C. G„ pp. 245—8).

Kraner suggests that animo may be dative. I am sure that
it is ablativo, and Meusel (L. C„ i, 267) agrees with me.

continuo. The MS. reading is contionatus, which Schneider
defends, remarking that Caesar addressed the loth legion in
a speech like that which he had just made to his generals
(45,§ 8); while Nipperdey (p. 95), who puts a comma alter
erat, aud therefore takes contionatus absolutely, says that Caesar
announced that, as he had achieved his purpose, he intended to
retreat. But if Caesar had made a speech on this occasion he
would not have mentioned it in his narrative, for it would have
been irrelevant. With Dittenberger, Meusel, and others Ι have
adopted von Goler's emendation.

ξ 2. satis magna valles. This valley is generally identified
with the hollow‚ or depression‚ which, M. Jullisn tells me, has
been largely filled up, west of the village of Gergovie. Nobody
who has scen the ground will admit that it was the broken
valley, or gor e, east of Ge1·govie; but M. J ullian believes that
it was the ho low between the Roche Blanche and the mountain
of Gergovia. 1 adhere to the general o inion‚ for the follow-
ing reasons. Gaesar says (ch. 49) that w en he saw his men in
difficulties he ordered Sextius, whom he had left in charge of
the camp on the Roche Blanche, to take up a position at the
