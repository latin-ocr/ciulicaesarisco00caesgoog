296 DE BELLO GALLICO

Abortive 26 Omnia experti Galli, quod res nulla successerat,
2¹}tss'ffipt postero die consilium ceperunt ex oppido profugere
gan-ison 2 hortante et iubente Vercingetorige. Id silentio noctis
ζζῗξέξῖ conati non magna iactura suorum sese effecturos
sperabant, propterea quod neque longe ab oppido ⁵
castra Vercingetorigis aberant et palus perpetua,
quae intercedebat, Romanos ad insequendum tardabat.
3 Iamque hoc facere noctu apparabant, cum matres
familiae repente in publicum procurrerunt flentesque ἵ
proiectae ad pedes suorum omnibus precibus petierunt 1⁰
ne se et communes liberos hostibus ad supplicium
dederent, quos ad capiendam fugam naturae et virium
4 infirmitas impediret. Ubi eos in sententia perstare
viderunt, quod plerumque in summo periculo timor
misericordiam non recipit, conclamare et significare 1⁵
5 de fuga Romanis coeperunt. Quo timore perterriti
Galli, ne ab equitatu Romanorum viae praeoccupa-
rentur, consilio destiterunt.

26, ξ 2. conati. Meusel (J. B„ 1894, p. 322) supplies εἰ Μ
after Id, arguin that without these words the meaning would be
that the Gauls egan to hope after they made their attempt,
whereas it was of course the hope that inspired the attempt.
But, even if conati cannot mean si essent conati (see the note on
v, 39, ξ 4), is it not possible that Caesar was anticipating the
description of the attempt which he gave in ξ 3, and that he
meant ⁸ As they made (or ‘ By making) the attempt in the still-
ness of night, they hoped ⁹, διο. ‘?

ξ 3. naturae. . . . infimitas. As we have seen, Caesar, notwith-

standing his terse style, is fond of using two nearly synonymons
or closely related words, where another writer might have been
content with one of the two. Naturae infimitas is the weakness
which was inherent in the sex of the women and the tendet
of the children ; then Caesar adds virium to indicate the kind of
weakness —not mental weakness—that he meant.
- 27,§ 1. perfectis has the support of two good MSS.,—a ands.
If derectis (αρ) were read, operibus would mean the sheds (vium)
and artillery (tormenta), a meaning sor which there is little or
no authority3 and, moreover, the words quae facere instituerat
would be meaningless.

mandata—not ‘ sentries’, but ‘guards'.
