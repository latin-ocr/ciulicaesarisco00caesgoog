Caesar nowhere else couples ius and leyes by aut, in 32, ξ 3 and
33, §§ 2-3 he speaks only of ἱερου and not of ius,

esset. The subjunctive shows that Caesar was not making the
statement from his own knowledge: the meaning is ‘those
between whom, aa he learned frum the Aeduos· magnates, the
dispute existed'. But to ex ress the force of the mood in
En lish without intolerable c umsiness is impomible: it must
be est to the im ‘nation. We should say ‘summoned the
whole council and {ge disputants themselves , &c.

3. oportuerit. See the last sentence of the note on 5, ξ 5.

4. intermissis magistratibus means, 1 think, ‘when magis-
trates were not in office ⁹, that is to say, when the magistracy—
the office of Vergobret (see i, 16, ξ 5)—was vacant; but how
Convictolitavis was elected is not clear. Schneider ex lains
immissis maqistmtibus in the sense that at the end o each
Vergobret's term of office there was mquam-ly a period of
interr-equum, in which the priests appointed his succeoeor; but
Caesar’s words seem to mean that the ri ht of appointment did
not ordinarily belong to the priests, an ‚ besides, er mandates
is not quite the same as a sacerdotibus: it imp ies that the

him. M. J ullian (H. G„ ii, 48) seems to think that the right of
appointment belonged to the magistrates of the various cla-ns,
and that as they did not exercise their right, it passed to the

a meaning which clashes w1th Gaesar's nse of the word (see
Meusel’s L. 0., ii, 221-2). Who the regular electore were is,
however, doubtful.

34, ξ 1. his is, I think, ri htly bracketed by Meusel (J. B„
1910, p. 60), who remarks t at it could only refer to contro·
versiamm ac dissensionis and would involve an intolerable
tautology. Ῑ hold With him thaff- omnibu-9 omiss-1⁶3 reba& ΨΜ
