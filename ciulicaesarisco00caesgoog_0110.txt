ξ 6. clientes here means dependent tribes. A state which had
‘cliente’ exercised over them whatever power it could; and
some cliente were less dependent u on the same state 111611
others. Thus the Cadurci, the Gaba i, 61111 1116 Vellavii were
under the imperium of the Arverni, and therefore had to render
milita service when required to do so (vii, 75, ξ 2) 61111

robab y also 10 pay tribute, as the Eburones did to the Atuatuci
{22⁷⁹ ξ 2); but the Carnutes, although they were clients of the
mi, were evidently not under their imperium, sor they rebelled

 

against Caesar when the Remi remained loyal (vi, 4, ξ 5). 0116111
tribes certainly managed their own internal affairs, and, 66 116
166111 from vi, 12, ἕξ 6-8, occasionally transferred their allegiance
from one powerful state to another (C. G„ pp. 517-19).
nobilitatem does not mean ‘ the nobility ’ or ⁸ the nobles ’‚ but
simply ‘men of rank': in other words, it does not denote 6
definite class, like our peerage, but merel the most prominent
membcrs of the class which Caesar (vi, 1 ‚ § 3) calls equites, or
knights. For in vi, 13, immediately after saying that in Gaul
there were only two classes which were held 111 any 66166111, 61111
immediately before saying that ‘one of the two classes consists
of the Druids, the other of the knights ', he makes this remark ε·-
‘ Generally‚ when crushed by debt or heavy taxation or ill-treated
by powerful individuals‚ they [the common people] bind them-
selves to serve men of rank' (plerique cum aut aere alieno aut
maqnitudine tributorum aut iniuria potentior-um premuntur, 6666
in sev-mutem dicant nobilibus). If the nobiles had formed a
definite class, superior to the equitem 066661 would have said
that there were only three classes which were held in any esteem.

equitatum. I am not quite sure whether equitatum 11616 11166116
‘cavalry' 01 ‘knighthood’,—i. 6. ‘knights' (666 p. lv 61111 11,
15). Of course the Aedui had not lost all their cavalry, as 15,
ξ 1 proves; but doubtless Diviciacus ex erated.

ξ 7. hospitio. 'Phe hospitium between thssgffomam and the Aedui
(666 p. xli) was an example of what was called hospitium publi-
cum,—a friendly agreement concluded between the Roman
People and a foreigner or a foreign state. The articles of the
agreement were regularly engraved on stone or bronze and
preserved in the Roman archivcs (D. S„ iii, 300-1).
