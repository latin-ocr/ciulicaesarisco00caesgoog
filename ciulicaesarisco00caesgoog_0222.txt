1¹7, ξ 1. Caesar . . . deonoemt. Caesar's bridge 'oined the
western bank of the Rhine to the territory of the ii, which
extended no further northward than Cologne or, more prob·
ably‚ the mouth of the Sieg, near Bonn (p. 430). Two years
later he built a second bridge paulo supra (vi, 9, ξ 3)-‘ a little
higher up' the river—which connected the territory os the
Treveri with that of the Ubii. If the rout of the Usipetes and
Tencteri took place near the Waal, we must of course look for
the site of the first bridge. as near that river as may be consis-
tent with Caesar's narrative. If, on the other hand, the rout
took place near the confluence of the Rhine and the Moselle.
thehbridge must have been made between Goblenz and Ander-
nac .

Napoleon 111 placed the first bridge at Bonn, for etting that
the second was higher up the river, and that he ad himself
said that between Bonn and Mainz ‘ the Rhine flows over
a rocky bed, where the piles could not have been driven in '.
If the Usipetes and Tencteri fled to the Waal‚ the first bridge
was most probably built at Cologne and the second at Bonn.
But Cologne is open to two objections. First, it was probably
opposite the territory not of the Ubii but of the Sugambri (see
p. 430). Secondly, if the Usipetes and Tencteri fled to the Waal,
the second bridge could not have been built further south than
Bonn 3 and it is most im robable that the territory of the Tre-
veri (see p. 431) extende so far northward.

A serious objection has, however, been brought against the
view that the bridges were between Coblenz and Andemach.
Major-General Wolf observes that in order to reach the Rhine
near Andernach in 53 13.c., Caesar would have been obli ed to

unable ιο seed his troops. In these circumstances, he says, the
arm would certainly have been attacked—in Germany by the
Sue i, 00 its return by the Treveri. 1 reply that when Caesar,
after building his second bridge, had crossed the Rhine, he was
in the territory of the friendl Ubii, upon whose assistance 110
could rely; that he did actua ly sear that he would be unable
to procure sufficient corn, and accordingly gave u his inten-
tion of penetrating far into Germany (vi, 29, ξ 1) ς {liat he took
every precaution ιο secure his rear (9, ξ 5) ς and that the policy
of the Suebi was not to attack him, but rather to lure 11110 00
