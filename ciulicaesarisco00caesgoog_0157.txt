Caesar, obsidibus acceptis primis civitatis atque 13 of the ⁸
10 ipsius Galbae regis duobus filiis armisque omnibus ex ,Βιθὲξέιᾬ

oppido traditis, in deditionem Suessiones accipit exer· pannum,
citumque in Bellovacos ducit. Qui cum se suaque 2
omnia in oppidum Bratuspantium contulissent atque
ab eo oppido Caesar cum exercitu circiter milia

whether you can improve upon this :—‘ On the following night,
before he could resume operatione, the whole host,’ διο.

ξ 5. αρρσηε here does not mean ⁶ an aqu’, or terrase, though
it does in 30, ξ 3. Ayyer primarily means material—earth or
what not—piled up in order to form a rampart, a terraee, or
some other military structure, or, as in this passage, shot into
a meat with the obJect of filling it up. Caesar uses the word
