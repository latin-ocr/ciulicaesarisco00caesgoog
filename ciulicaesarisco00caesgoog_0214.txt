136 DE BELLO GALLICO

appellatur Vacalus insulamque efficit Batavorum, in
2 Oceanum influit neque longius ab Oceano milibus
3 passuum LXXX in Rhenum influit. Rhenus autem
oritur ex Lepontiis‚ qui Alpes incolunt, et longo spatio
per fines Nantuatium, Helvetiorum, Sequanorum, Me· 5
diomatricorum, Tribocorum, Treverorum citatus fertur
4 et, ubi Oceano adpropinquavit, in plures diffluit partes

the passive, incolitur (ξ 4). These objections are not all equally
stron (is citatus, for instance, more poetical than incitavisset
[iii, 13, ξ 1] or than proynati and obitum [ii‚ 29, §§ 4-51?)‚ and
some mi ht perhaps be refuted (see the note on ξ 1); but their
combine force cannot be ignored (Ο. G.. p. 692, n. 2).

It would not, however, be safe ιο set the chapter aside as
having no historical value. Instead of ab Oceano (ᾗ 1) the Aldine
edition (1513) has ab eo, and an inferior MS. ab Rhen03 while
both have in Oceanum instead of in Rhenum5 but the reader
need not trouble himself about various readings, for, whatever
reading we ado t, the writer places the junction of the Mense
(Mosa) and the eVaal (Vacalus) at a point about 80 Roman miles
from the sea. What that point was ιι is im ssible to say with
certainty. The Mense now joins the Waa near Gorkum, and
before 1856 it was joined to it by a channel at Fort St. Andr-ies
as well; but, according to P. Cluver, a geo pher of the seven-
teenth century, both these 'unctions were ue to modern canali-
zation‚ and in the time of aesar the Mense quitted its present
bed at Megen and joined the western branch of the Rhine at
Geervliet, only 7 miles from the sea. I have not been able
to find any satisfactory evidence for this theory; and it con·
tradicts not only the cha ter before us but also the testimony
of Tacitus (Aura, ii, 6), w ο says that at the ‘be ‘nning’, or
eastern extremity, of the insula Batavorum the R ine divides
into two branches; that the northern branch flows ιο the sea;
that the southern branch, under the name of Vahalis (wad),
flows on until it joins the Meuse; and that the Mense flows on
to the sea (0.G., p. 689-96). Probably in Caesar‘s time, as
now, the Mense c osely ap reached the Waal at Fort St. An·
dries and joined it at Gor um, while a braneh of the Mense
may have flowed westward from Heusden (south of Gorkum)
in the direction of the modern artificial water-course. See
A. Norlind‚ Die yeoyr. Entwickluny d. Rheindeltas, 1912, pp. 71-2.

ξ 1. Batavorum. J .H. Holwerda (Mnemosyne, xli, 1913‚p . 1-9),
who is apparently unaware that the authenticity of this c pter
has been challenged, argues that the Batavi were settled in the
valley of the lower Rhine by Caesar himself. He infers from
archaeological evidence that the settlement took lace shortly
before the Christian era3 and, remarking that the atavi were a
tribe of the Chatti, and that, according to Dion Cassius (liv, 36,
ᾗ 3), lands had been assigned by the Romans to the Chatti before
10 Β. ο.. he concludes that their benefactor could only have been
Caesar or Agri pa, the latter of whom, as far as we know, assigned
lands ιο the ii only. Meusel perhaps forgets that the Batavi
were mentioned among Caesar's auxiliaries by Lucan (i, 431).
