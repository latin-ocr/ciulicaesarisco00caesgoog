formed one state or even a confederation: each of the
three was a group of tribes, which Caesar called civitates.
The tribe was generally an aggregate, more or less com·
pact, of communities to which he gave the name of pass,
he members of which had originally been related by
blood or by near neighbourhood ; but it would seem that
some of the smaller tribes consisted each of one payns
only. Each payns, under its own magistrate, appears
to have enjoyed a certain measure of independence‚ and
to have contributed its separate contingent to the tribal
host. Each tribe had its council, which Caesar called
a senate, and had once had its king: but when Caesar
came to Gaul revolutionary forces were at work to which
there were analogies in the earlier history of Greece and
Rome. Many of the states had expelled their king&
'whose authority had passed in some cases into the hands
of annually elected magistrates, while in others perhaps
the council kept the government to itself. A rule which
prevailed among the Aedui illustrates the anxiety which
was felt lest monarchical power should revive. In that
state the chief magistrate, who was known as the Ver·
gobret, was forbidden to stir beyond the frontiers of
the country, from which it may be inferred that it was
not lawful for him to command the host. The executive
was generally weak. Some of the smaller communities
of which a tribe was composed occasionally acted on their
own account, in opposition to the rest or to the policy of
the tribal authorities, Like the Anglo-Saxon thanes and
the Norman barons, the nobles surrounded themselves
with retainers—loyal followers or enslaved debtors ; and
none but those who became their dependants could be
sure of protection. On the other hand, none but those
who were strong enough to protect could be sure of
obedience. The. oligarchies were no more secure than
the monarchs whom they had supplanted. These men
or their descendants sullenly plotted for the restoration
of their dynasties‚ and, reckless of the common weal,
they were in the mood to court the aid even of a foreign
conqueror, and to reign as his nominees. Here and
there some wealthy noble, like Pisistratus in Athene,
