these general rules were subject to exceptione: indeed he will
see on the map that in some places boundaries are wanting.
That means that there is not enou h evidence to define them.
In this little book it would be out o place to discuss the excep·
tions3 but that has been done in Caesar's Conquest os Gaul.
However, one instance will show how difficulties arise. Caesa
(vii, 75, ξ 2) mentions the Aulerci Brannovices‚ who were de-
pendants (clientes) of the Aedui, and of course possessed territory.
Phis territory was afterwards included in one of the dioceses
which were formed out of the territo of the Aedui; but we
{annot lind out how much of the ’ocese belonged to the
rannovices.

Agedincum, the chief town of the Senones, stood upon the
site of Sens, which preserves their name, and which tonrists pass
on their way to Dijon (C. G„ pp. 353-4).

,Alesia covered the plateau of Mont Auxois, on the south·
western slope of which stands the village of Aliae-Sainte-
Reine, about 32 miles north-west of Dijon. Although seven
other sites have been pro osed, this identification is ed
as absolutely certain by all-competent inquirers. Ι wil state

First, Mont Auxois is the only hill the geographical position
of which rees with what Caesar says about his own position
on the day efore he reached Alesia and with what he says about
his distribution of the legions after the ca ture of Alesia (vii, 90,
§§ 1-4). On the day before he reached ssia he fought a battle
with Vercin etorix 67); on the night before this battle, when
he was marc ing ⁶ t rough the surthest rt of the country of
the Lingones towards the country of the quani, that he might
be in a better position for reinforcing the Province', he encamped
10 Roman nules from the encampment of Vercingetorix (66,
§§ 2-3). lt follows that the eneampment of Vercingetorix, close
to which the battle was fought, was either in ‘the furthest part
of the count of the Lingones ’ or in the country of the Sequani,
less than 10 man miles from the Saone, which separated them
from the Lingones. The beaten Gauls fled to Alesia. Caesar
pursued them till nightfall and reached the outskirts of Alesia
on the next day. It is therefore evident and is univermlly ad·
mitted that Alesia could not have been more than 35, or thaps
at the very outside 40 miles from the battle-field. Sout of the
Saone the only conceivable site—the only site that has ever
been su gested—answering to these conditione, is Alaise. North
of the aene the only conceivable site—the only site that has
ever been suggested at all—is Mont Auxois. Alesia had been

must not only have knoewn sgggral geseke beforehand that caesar
intended to march through the country of the Sequani, but must
have left the all-important city os Bibracte exposed to Gaesar’s
attaek. At Mont Auxois, on the other hand, he would have been
in a central position, from which he could striks at Caesar,
whatever route Caesar might take. Furthermore, on the south
of the Saone it is impossible to discover any satisfactory sits for
the battle that immediately preceded the blockade of Alesia-
