Perhaps the Helvetii crossed the Saone at various points; for it
has been suggested that if they had all crossed at one, they
would have opposed Caesar’s assage (0. G„ p. 616).

For military purposes the Romans divided the period between

the Helvetii robably crossed the Saone between Trevoux and

in the country of the Segusiavi (10, ξ 5) and probably south of
Trevou13 for Trevoux,be1ng situated between two places called
Amberieux‚ may have belonged to the Ambarri. South of
Trevoux the most suitable spot for a camp is on the heights
which command Sathonay. The Tigurini were evidently not
more than a few miles north of Caesar's camp3 and we may
infer that tbe route by which they had a proached the Saone
was the valley of the Formans. This va ley is dominated on
