COMMENTARIUS I 31

est, propterea quod pro vallo carros obiecerant et e
loco superiore in nostros venientes tela coiciebant et
non nulli inter carros rotasque mataras ac tragulas
subiciebant nostrosque vulnerabant. Diu cum esset 4

ad Lingonas litteras nuntiosque misit, ne eos frumento
neve alia re iuvarent: qui si iuvissent, se eodem loco

omnibus copiis eos sequi coepit.

ξ 3. rotas seems at first sight su erfluous; and some editors
adopt Meiser's emendation, raedas cf. 51, ξ 2). Perhaps, how-
ever, (inter carros) rotae(que) may be defended on the analogy
of inter carros impedimentaque (iv, 14, ξ 4), is we may suppose that
in the latter case the baggage was in the cartu and, moreover,
the wheels may have played a partin the defence. See . 436.

marches and to imply that the Helvetii tested by day, whic is
more than improbable, he would have written not noctis but
noctium C'. G„ pp. 6332-3). Meusel (J.·B., 1910, . 55) also ’

are unnecessary. Suspicione they certainly are ; but I can
conceive that, after writing them, Caesar wrote tm‘duo inter-
misso, and forgot that he was repeating himself.

In translating die quarto we must remember that the Romans
as a rule reckoned inclusively. Thus if the battle was fought
on a Sunday, the Helvetii reached the count of the Lingones
on Wednesday; but it is impossible to tell w at point in that
country they had reached when Caesar overtook them. They
may have retreated to Dijon, the place which they would
naturall have made for if, as is probable, they already
ient-gud tggxietxirn to Switzerland. See the note on 30, ξ 5, and
