Civiliza-
tion of the
Gauls.

xlviii INTRODUCTION

Thus when Caesar entered Gaul, the groups whom he
called Belgae, Celtae, and Aquitani were each a medley of
different races. The Belgae were the purest and the least
civilized of the three ; and both in Belgic and in Celtican
Gaul the Celtic conquerors had imposed their language
upon the conquered peoples. Even in a political sense,
the Belgae and the Celtae were not separated by a hard
and fast line; for the Celtican tribe of the Carnutes was
among the dependants of the Belgic Remi, while on the
other hand the Celtican Aedui claimed supremaey over
the Belgio Bellovaci. But if not scientifically complete,
the grouping adopted by Caesar was sufficient for the
purpose of his narrative. Just as a modern conqueror,
without troubling himself about questions of ethnology,

might say that the people of Great Britain were composed
of Englishmen, Scotsmen, and Welsh, so Caesar divided

the people of Gaul into Belgae, Celtae, and Aquitani.
Setting aside the Aquitani, of whom he had little to tell,
the medley of peoples whom he called ‘Galli’ had pro·
bably so far coalesced that they had acquired certain
common traits of character. Perhaps when he described
the features of the Gallio temperament which had most
impressed him in the course of the war, he took little

note of the lowest class, the cultivators and the shepherds, -

who had not much to do with political life: but we can
hardly suppose that his remarks applied only to the
ruling class or to the purer Celts ;ι and, guided by his
observations, we cannot go far astray. The Gauls were
an interesting people, enthusiastic, impulsive, quick·
witted, versatile, vainglorious and ostentatious, childishly
inquisitive and childishly credulouS‚ rash, sanguine, and
inconstant, arrogant in victory and despondent in defeat,
submissive as women to their priestS, impatient of law
and discipline, yet capable of loyalty to a strong and

sympathetic ruler.
'Phe notices which Caesar and other writers have left of

their civilization have been supplemented by the evidence
of archaeology. Five centuries before the birth of Christ
