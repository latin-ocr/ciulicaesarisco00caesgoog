vis-sent, though if Caesar had written that, he would also have
written pollicitus esset. Perhaps, as in ξ 2, primary tenses
were used because the event described was recent.

Most editors say that quisque stands for quae ue civitas or
quaeque pars Belyarum: but'although the severa contingents
were of course provided by the tribes, the tribes evidently could
not make a promise ‘in the general council of the Belgae';
and Caesar wrote isque because he was thinking of the indi-
vidual delegates w o attended the council.

§2 Apud eos . . . obtinuerit. This Diviciacus must not be
confused with the Aeduan Druid of the same name, who is
mentioned in this Commentary (5, ξ 2; 10, ξ 5; 14, ξ] ; 1ξ),ξ 1)
as well as in the first. Britanniae is a loose expression: it can
only mean South·Eastern Britain‚—the part which Caesar in·
vaded in 55 and in 54 Β. 0. ; sor it is plainly incredible that the
power of Diviciacus should have extended beyond that part os
the country which had been conquered by the Belgae (v, 12,
ξ 2). What was the nature of his imperium *Ρ One cannot sup-
pose that he had invaded Britain with an armada and conquered
his Bel ‘c kinemen. When Caesar came to Gaul the tribes of
Seuth- astern Britain were divided into ant onistic groups‚
headed respectivel by the Catuvellauni—t e subjecte of
Cassivellaunus—an the Trinovantes (Α. Β., pp. 299-300); and
I am inclined to believe that after Diviciacus had made himself
overlord of a ‘large part of the Belgic territory’ in Gaul
(magnae partis harum reqionum), some of the British tribes had
sought his aid against their nvals, and had purchased it by
recognizing his supremacy and perhaps also by paying tribute.

obtinuerit. See the note on i, 31, ξ 8.
