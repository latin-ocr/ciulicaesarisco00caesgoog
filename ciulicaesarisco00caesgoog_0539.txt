APPENDIX 443

in a moment she would overset and founder. The ships
which were carried back to the point from which they had
started were of course handled differently,’ &c. Again‚ on
p. 582, speaking of the transporta that ran before the wind,
1 wrote, ‘ They were in no danger of being driven ashore3
for while the gale was at its height they stood out to sea.’
Referring to the latter passage, Mr. Wightman says, ‘ This
reasoning seems to me inconsequent. When Caesar says
the ships were being carried out of their course, all we are
to understand therefrom is that they were falling rapidly
to leeward 3 and as he plainly tells us land was under their
199 bow, the danger to which he refers is obviously that 91
striking. To avert this it was necessary to tack ship and
stand off shore. But the fact that they did this while the
gale was still at its height does not warrant the assump-
tion that they were in no danger of being driven ashore
when on the other tack standing westward.’

The radical error in this criticism lies in the words ‘as
he plainly tells us land was under their 199 bow, the danger
to which he refers is obviously that of striking ⁹. Caesar
does not tell us that ‘ land was under their 199 bow ⁹.
What he does tell us is that ‘they were getting close to
Britain and were seen from the camp, when such a violent
storm suddenly arose that none of them could keep their
course, but some were carried back to the point from which
they had started, while others were swept down in great
peril ¹ towards the lower and more westerly part of the

² ΜΓ. Wightman eavils at my translation of mamm suo cum micula,
which he would render by ‘at (or ‘to their ') great peril ’. What
is the essential difference? Were the Roman traders not in danger
when they crossed the Alps mayno cum periculo (iii, 1, 5 2)? Or
Cicero’s troops when they were defending their camp (v, 52, 5 8) P
Does Er. Wightman mean that the ships were not in peril? He
cannot mean this ς 191· 119 says himself that ‘ the danger to which he
[Caesar] refers is obviously that 91 striking’, and that we must not
assume ‘that they were in no danger 91· being driven ashore ’. 11·
they were ‘in danger of being driven ashore ’, why does Mr. wight-
man find fault with my translation ? And why did their captains
fatuously incur this danger, when all that they had to do, in order
to avoid it, was immediately to follow the example of the other group
91 transports‚—‘ tack ship and stand off shore ’ *ἒ

Perhaps ΜΓ. Wightman, although his own words imply that the
ships were in danger, means that they would only have been in
danger 11 they had approached so near 9 199 shore that striking
would have been inevitable. But if so, the word ‘ danger ' would be
inadequate. Anyhow in all the other passages in which Caesar uses
the phrase maeno (orqumtto) campet-imdo—i, 10, 5 23 17, 565 47, 5 33
iii, 1, 5 23 v, 16, 523 19, 5 23 47, 5 5; 52, 583 vii, 14, 5 7—he plainly
means that the individuals or groups in question were in danger.

01 course in certain passages, e. g. iii, 1, 52, may-no eum periendo
might advantageously be translated, with no essential difference 91
meaning, by ‘ at great risk ’.
