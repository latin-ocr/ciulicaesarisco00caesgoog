else than coactis ⁹. Ι take it that coactis means simply ‘ raised ’
or ‘ collected’ (cf. ii, 5, ξ 4; iii, 16, § 2; vi, 7, f 1; vii, 5, § 1)
and that contractis means ⁴ assembled ’ (in one p ace).

§4. eundem portum obviously denotes the port in which the
eight transporta and the galleys that were to convoy them
(ξ 3) ad assembled, and from which Caesar set sail (23, ξ 1).
This port was the estua of the Liane,—in other words, the
harbour of Boulogne, thegallie name of which was Gesoriacum.
Caesar embarked from the country of the Morini (see p. 424)
‘because the shortest p e to Britain was from their coast ’
(21, ξ 3) : Boulogne, which liny (Nat. Hist„ iv, 23, ξ 122) calls
the portus Morinorum Britan-nicus, was the permanent naval
station of the Romans under the Empire and the port from
which they habitually sailed to Britain: it was the only har-
bour in the country of the Morini which Pliny mentioned3 and,
accordin to Pomponius Mela (iii, 2, ξ 23), it was the most re·
nowned arbour on the northern coast of Gaul. These facts
make it probable that Caesar sailed from Boulogne3 another
proves it. The cavalry transports mentioned in ξ 4 sailed from
a ort 8 Roman miles from his own starting-point. He
cal s it the ulterior portus (23, l) and the superior portus (28,
ξ 1); and it was therefore nort or north-east of the port from
which he himself sailed. If he sailed from Boulogne, the ul·

country of the Morini—wissant, between Cape Blanc-Nez and
Ga 6 Gris-Nez—the ulterior porcus was Sangatte. That he
sai ed from Ambleteuse himself is absolutely incredible‚ for 116
would not have selected such a small hai-bour for the bulk of
his fleet. The cavalry transports were unable to start until the
fourth day after he landed in Britain. When they were ap-

ried back to the point from which they had started, while the
others were swept down in great peril towards the lower and
more westerly part of the island ¹ (28, §§ 1-2). It will be shown
in the note on 23, § 6 that ansar’s camp was in the neighbour-
hood of Walmer. But it is not necessary to assume this in
order to rove that the cavalry transports started from Amble-
teuse; igr all the nautica] experts whom I have ‘consulted
agree with me that it is incredible that a gale which drove
some of the ships westward down the coast carried the others
back to Sangatte. Anybody who may wish to satisfy himself
’ that this conclusion, which has been generally accepted, is true
