aestus complebat, et onerarias, quae ad ancoras erant
deligatae, tempestas adflictabat, neque 'ulla nostris
facultas aut administrandi aut auxiliandi dabatur.
Compluribus navibus fractis, reliquae cum essent 3
10 funibus, ancoris reliquisque armamentis amissis ad
navigandum inutiles, magna, id quod necesse erat
accidere, totius exercitus perturbatio facta est. Neque 4
enim naves erant aliae quibus reportari possent, et
omnia deerant quae ad reficiendas naves erant usui,

frumentum in his locis in hiemem provisum non erat.

29, ξ 1. qui . . . consuevit. This statement is not quite
accurate. off the Kentish coast the highest tides-spring
tides, as they are called-occur 22} days after full moon.

nostris e . . . incognitam. There will always remain a doubt
whether aesar did not know more than he chose to admit: the
native ski pers, who navi ted his transports, which were of
course Gal ic vessels, coul certainly have enli htened him.

§2. et lonyas naves . . . adflictabat. The di culty resented
by this passage is that no troops, so far as we know, ad been
carried in the galleys (lonqas naves), except artillerymen,
archers, and elingere (25, ξ 1). Vielhaber deleted quibus . . .
curaverat, and was therefore compelled to substitute quas Caesar
for quasque. Meusel, who in his critical edition followed
Vielhaber, afterwards adopted the emendation of Mommsen,
who only deleted longas and onerarias. This emendation must,'
however, be rejected, because it implies that the transporte—
-—(naves) onerarias—were beached and that the galleys rode at
anchor; whereas it is evident and is im lied both in 24, ξ 2 and
in v, 1,§ 2 that the trans orts used in t e expedition of 55 Β. O.
were too large to be beac ed, and that the galleys, which drew
less water, were not. May we suppose that Caesar wrote (Ita
uno tempore et) lonqas naves, quas Caesar in aridum subduxerat,
aestus complebat, et onerarias, quibus exer-citum transportandum
curaverat quaeque ad ancoras eram ἀεῑίραίαε, tempestas ad-
flictabat ⁴? If this conjecture, of which I am not at all
enamoured, will not do, I fear that we must follow Vielhaber
(C. R„ May, 1912, p. 93).

amitam is here, as osten, used of the infantry in contra·
distinction to the cavalry.
