CEN IMAGNI—CORIOSOLITES 415

it was not Orleans it must have been Gien. There is no
evidence that at Gien there was either a bridge or a Gallio
town. As, however, Colonel Stoffel (see p. xxxv) was an advocate
of Gien, we must not ignore his reasons. He identified Vel-
launodunum, from which Caesar marched in two days to
Cenabum (11, §§ 1-5), with Toucy, which is 37 miles east of
Gien3 and he insisted that this was just the distance which
Caesar would have covered in two marches. But there is no
evidence whatever that Vellaunodunum was at Toucy.

On the other hand, there is conclusive evidence that Cenabum
was not at Gien. First, after the conquest of Gaul Gien was
not in the territory of tho Carnutes, but in that of the Senones3
and there is no reason to suppose that since Caesar-'s time it
had changed hands. Secondly, it was not called Cenabum in
the Middle Ages, but Giemus. Thirdly, in 51 13.o. Caesar lest
two legions at Cenabum to overawe the Carnutes (viii, 6, § 1).
If Cenabum was at Gien, even assuming that Gien was in the
country of the Carnutes, the legions were posted 011 1118 eastern
limit of the Carnutian territory. me such a position how
would they have been able to keep the Carnutes in check ⁶?

'l'he conclusion, that Cenabum and Orleans were one, is as
certain as that Lutecia stood upon the island of NotreDamc
and Alesia upon Mont Auxois (C. G„ p. 405-15).

Ceutrones (a).-—'1'he Alpine Ceutrones (i, 10, ᾗ 4) occupied
the valley of the 'l'arentause and the adjoining mountains.
Their frontier has been determined by an inscription which was

coenantem-Coequosa, between Dax and Boideaux, which
is mentioned 111 1118 Itium-ary of Antonine (p. 456), was doubtless
the chief town of the Cocosates. Their territory was therefore
in the western part of the department of Les Landes, between
Castetz and Mimizan 0. G„ p. 415).

Condrusi—'Phe ondrusi were conterminous with the
Eburones (iv, 6, ξ 41, ‘the greater part of whose territory’, says
Caesar (v, 24, ξ 4), ‘is between the Mense and the Rhine’ ς and
they were between the Eburones and the Treveri (vi, 32, ξ 1).
Accordingly they are generally believed to have inhabited
Condroz, which extends along the right bank of the Mense,
between Liege and Dinant, and which 111 1118 11111111 century was

Oorioeohteffi— his people mhabited the country round
Corseul in the department of the Cotes-du·Nord. Their
frontiers cannot be certainly defined, because the geography
of this part of Gaul is obscure. The number of dioceses in the
Aremoncan eninsula (Brittany) greatly exceeds the number
of states: a of them, except those of Vannes, Nantes, and
Rennes, were created after the Gallo-Roman period by invaders
from Britain; and when those invaders formed their dioceses
they took no account of the existing political divisions. On
