424 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX

the Scheldt; and if it was not, Ptolemy does not mention the
Scheldt at all. But every other ancient writer who mentions
the Scheldt calls it Scaldis; and Walckenaer maintains that
the 'Pabula was the Aa. The known ancient name of the Aa
was, however, Aqm'o or Aym'ona: so it is clear that either the
Aa or the Scheldt had two names; and the balance of proba-
bilit is evidently in favour of identifying the 'Pabula with
the cheldt. Here a difficulty arises. A place called Castellum
Menapiorum, which is mentioned in the Table of Pessum
(p. 13, 661. 2), was undoubtedly Caesel, about 11 miles north·
east of St. Omerz therefore, unless Menapiorum was written by
mistake for Morinorum, the Scheldt was not the eastern boun·
dary of the Morini when the Tabia was compiled. But the
castellum of the Menapii is also mentioned by Ptolemy; and
as he makes the Meuse their western frontier, it is clear that,
unless he defined their position wron ly, the castellum which
he mentions was not 066661. Perhaps t e Morini were punished
for their repeated revolts in the time os Caesar by bein foroed
to surrender the eastern part of their territory to the enapii;
if sc, we may suppose that Castellum Menapiorum (066661) was
not built or did not belong to the Mena ii until after they
migrated into this district. My own belie is that in Caesar-‘s
time the Scheldt, as a natural boundary, formed the common
frontier of the two tribes: if the Menapii had then possessed
the country between the Scheldt and the Aa, it would be
difficult to understand why they only contributed 7,000 men
to the Belgio host in 57 B.c. (ii, 4, ξ 9), while the Morini con·
tributed 25‚000 (C'. G„ pp. 449-53).

Morini.—The Morini were bounded on the west by the
Ambiani, from whom they were separated by the river Canche,
on the south by the Atrebates (and perhaps also by the Nervii),
and on the east by the Menapii (Strabo, ιν, 3, §53 Pliny, Nat.
Hist„ iv, 17, ξ 106). Their eastern fmntier, as I have shown
in 1211} preceding article, was probably the Scheldt (C. G„
ppNamneiea—The territory of this tribe corresponded with
the ancient diocese of Nantes, or that portion of the de
ment of the Loire·Inferieure which lies on the right ban of
{heGLoire,5and is bounded on the north-east by the Semnon

resultantes—The Nantuates cssed the territory that
extended on the south of the l e of Genera as far west as
the frontier of the Allobroges (iii, 1, ξ 1), which was probably
formed by the river Dranse. As their chief town, Agaunum,
stood upon the site of St. Maurice, and their eastern neighbours,
the Veragri (q. v.), occupied the western part of the Valais,
the territo of the Nantuates comprised the eastern part
of tGhe 01125136-ἰέ and the north-western part of the Valais
( In ivppo’ which was not written by Caesar, it is said that the
Rhine rises in the country of the Lepontii, and flows through
the countries of the Nantuates, Helvetii, Sequani, Mediomatrici,
Triboci, and Treveri. If the unknown writer did not make
a blunder, these Nantuates were different—different as a group,
if not in blood—from the Nantuates mentioned in iii, 1, ξ 1,
