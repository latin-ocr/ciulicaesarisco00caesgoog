26 DE BELLO GALLICO

quod timore perterritos Romanos discedere a se ex-
istimarent, eo magis quod pridie superioribus locis 5
occupatis proelium non commisissent, sive eo quod
re frumentaria intercludi posse confiderent, commu-
tato consilio atque itinere converso nostros a novis-
simo agmine insequi ac lacessere coeperunt.

old emendation‚—eaeistimans.

§2 equitum Gallorum. The adjective of Gallus is Gallicus,
but Caesar never uses it as an epithet of living beings. The
phrase equites Galla· is like mare Oceanus·

Meusel (J. B., 1894, p. 332), remarking that both Caesar and
Cicero often use such verbs in the subjunctive where logically
the indicative might seem preferable, says that, strictly speak-
ing, the clause should run either seu quod . . . existimabant or

Caesar struck his camp on the morning os the battle he was not
more than 18 Roman miles— and we ma safely assume that he
was not much less—from Bibracte (23, 1), which was situated
on Mont Beuvray (see p. 411): when he was attached he was
marching towards that town ; and the Helvetii, who, on hearing
of his movement, had reversed their march (23, ἕξ 243), were
trying to inter-cept him. Evidently, therefore, the battle-field
was close to a point where a road leading to Mont BeEg-rffl„
diverged from the route by which the Helvetn had been marc ing
to Samtonge (10, ξ 1). It was also somewhere south-east, south,

on their way to Saintonge. It is now generally agreed that
the only site which fulfils all the conditione is about 3 mlles
north-west of Toulon-sur-Arroux, and that the hill on the lower
slopes of which Caesar formed his army was the hill of Armecy.
The site was first pointed out in 1867; and some ears later
Stoffel discovered by excavation an entrenchment on e plateau.
This enti-enchment could only have been intended to serve a
temporary purpose, for its shape was that of a crescent, the
width from horn to horn being only about 300 yards; and there
are irregularities in it which seem to show that it was con·
structed in a hurry. 1 am inclined to think that the men who
erecte-d it may have stopped work when they saw that the battle
was going in favour of their comrades: this supposition would
