7, ξ 1. hiemabat. The reading of a-ht’emacemt——would im ly
that Labienus had wintered in the country of the Treveri, gut
was there no longer. It is true that 3, ξ 4 shows that winter,

oubt that hiemabat is right.

ᾗ 5. Erat . . . penei-aptis. M. Jnllian, who was anticipated b
H. L. Long‚ identifies this river with the Semoy, ancl the kno l
(tumulus) mentioned in 8, ξ 3 with a hill between Mouzon and
lzel: bnt is the district between Mouzon and Izel the only one
in Luxemburg that corresponds with Caesar’s narrative ⁴? Any-
how Mouzon is about 80 Roman miles from Tongres, which
M. J ullian identifies with Atuatuca (see 32, ἓξ 3-4 and p. 407),
whereas Caesar (v, 27, ξ 9) implies that the camp of Labienus
was only a little more than 50 Roman miles from that stronghold
(C. G„ pp. 383-4) and (v, 30, ξ 3) that an army consisting of
a legion and five cohorte-say about 6‚000 men-could march
thence to it, οι· to the rather nearer camp of Cicero, in two days.

ξ 6. consulto is an emendation, proposed by W. A. Becker.
The MS. reading—in concilio-is evidently open to ob'ection3
sor it implies that in a council of war Labienus deli rately
made a remark the motivo of which he did not expect the
officers who were present to understand; that he reckoned on
some of the officers repeating this remark outside the council
in the hearing of the Gallic troope1s3 and that in a second
council (ξ 8) he explained to his officers what he had meant.
Moreover, it deprives the word palam of all point. It seems
more probable that Labienus would have made the remark
openly in the camp before the troopers‚ and that he would
have held only one council.
