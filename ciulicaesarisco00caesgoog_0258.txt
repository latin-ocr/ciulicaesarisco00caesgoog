176 DE BELLO GALLICO

quod esse ex usu Galliae intellexissent communi con-
silio administrarent. Haec a compluribus ad Caesarem
deferebantur.

7 Qua re cognita Caesar, quod tantum civitati Hae-
duae dignitatis tribuebat, coercendum atque deter- 5
rendum, quibuscumque rebus posset, Dumnorigem

2 statuebat <et,> quod longius eius amentiam progredi
videbat, prospiciendum ne quid sibi ac rei publicae

3 nocere posset. Itaque dies circiter XXV in eo loco
commoratus, quod Corus ventus navigationem im· 10
pediebat, qui magnam partem omnis temporis in his
locis flare consuevit, dabat operam ut in officio Dum-
norigem contineret, nihilo tamen setius omnia eius

4 consilia cognosceret3 tandem idoneam nactus tem-
pestatem milites equitesque conscendere naves iubet. 16

5 At omnium animis impeditis Dumnorix cum equitibus
Haeduorum a castris insciente Caesare domum dis·

6 cedere coepit. Qua re nuntiata Caesar, intermissa
profectione atque omnibus rebus postpositis, magnam
partem equitatus ad eum insequendum mittit retrahi· 20

taking reliquis as meaning all exce t Dumnorix himself, that is
to say, all those with whom he ha intrigued: it is opposed to
ΡᾚῘοέρέ §.mbr-mrum is probably ” ht in believing that the
conjunction, which is wanting ιιι ῐὶιθῖξὸδη was m the archetype.

ξ 3. commoratus is not exactly equivalent to the present par-
ticiple. As Madvig sa (Lat. Gr„ ξ 431. b), the past pattici le of
deponente is often useffito indicate the motive, occaslon [as ere],
or manner of the main action ’.—‘ For about twenty-five days . . .
he was kept waiting. . . . Accordingly he did his best to keep
Dumnorix steady,' &c.

Corus ventus may be translated by ‘ the north-west wind ’ ;
but as the ancients had no compasses, they could not tell with
mathematical precision the pomt from which the wind was
blowing. In Caesar's time the circle from any point of which
the wind may blow was divided into twelve equal parts; and
accordingly the wind called Corus may have blown from any
quarter between NW. and W. by N. N. (A.B., . 555, n. 2).

§ 5. cum itibus Haeduorum. n 58 B.c. umnorix had
commanded t e Aeduan cavalry which served under Caesam
and a parently he did so still. Why Cacsar accepted or em·
ploye as commander of this allied force a man whom he so
thoroughly distrusted, we do not know3 probably he was
unwillin to provoke him to open opposition until he felt able

to get ri of him.
