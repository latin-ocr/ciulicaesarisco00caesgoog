lviii INTRODUCTION

varietiesg has blended them in a harmonicus whole! The
wayfarer who roams from the saud-hilis of the Channel
to the mountains of Auvergne, from the uplands of the
Morvanto the plain of the Berri, conversing with peasant
and townsman in turn, who is touched by the spirit of
prehistoric life wafted from the rude stone monuments of
Brittany and by the spirit of imperial Rome which broods
over the mediaeval glories of Bourges and over that
ancient town ¹ which is being revealed by the excavator
on Mont Auxois—who feels how one influenced the other
and both survive in our Mechanical Age—will compre·
hend what the geographer means; and for him the tale
which Caesar told will become real.

And in Gaul, as in England before the Norman
Conquest, there was another influence which in some
measure counteracted disunion,—community of religious
ideas, controlled by one ecclesiastical organization. Local
deities of course abounded: but the great gods whom
Caesar noticed, however variously they may have been
conceived by various tribeS, were common to Gaul ; while
every rite and every sacrifice was recognized and regu·
lated by Druidism.²

But though religion might perhaps foster the idea, it
could not supply the instant need of political union.
Over the vast wooded plains of Germany fierce hordes
were roaming‚ looking with hungry eyes towards the
rich prize that lay beyond the Rhine. Moreover‚ the
danger of Gaul was the danger of Italy. The invader
who had been attracted by ‘the pleasant land of France ’
would soon look southward over the cornfieldS, the vine·
yards, and the olive-gardens of Lombardy. When Caesar
was entering public life, men who were not yet old could
remember the terror which had been inspired by the
Cimbri and Teutoni—those fair-haired giants who had
come down, like an avalanche, from the unknown lands
that berdered on the northern sea. They descended into
the valley of the Danube. They overthrow a Roman
consul in Oarinthia 3 crossed the Rhine and threaded the
passes of the J ura3 and overran the whole of Celtican
