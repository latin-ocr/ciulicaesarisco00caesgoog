BIBROCI—CENABUM 413

country of the latter was part of the Roman Province3 and
when Caesar was emphasizin the danger that was likely to
threaten the Province if the elvetii were allowed to settle in
the country of the Santoni (i, 10, §§ 1-2), he would have said
that the country of the Santoni was not far from the country of
the Cadurci instead of saying that it was not sar from the country
of the Tolosates. Some editors su pose that Caesar wrote not
Eleutetis but Helvii83 but the He vii fought against Vercin-
getorix (vii, 65, ξ 2), whereas Eleutetis occurs in the list of tribes
which sent troo s to help him. 1 doubt whether Caesar wrote
Eleuteti-93 but i he did, the Eleuteti were distinct from the
Cadurci (0. G„ pp. 402—3).

Caverna—This tribe is believed to have occupied a tract
called in the eighth century payns Car-os or Cametas, north of
Treves and on the banks of the Prum (C. G„ p. 403).

caleti—The territory of this people·included the Pays de
Caux (payns Calmes), or the western and the central portion of
the department of the Seine (0. G.. p. 404).

Cantabri.—The Cantabri inhabited the northern part of
{pai} between the Basque Provinces and the neighbourhood of

vie o. .

Cantium corresponded approximately with Kent.

Carcaso stood upon the site of the modern Carcassonne.

Carnutes—The territory of the Carnutes comprised the
dioceses of Chai-tres, Orleans¹ and Blois, or the greater part of
{gegeparlffiffts of the Eure-et·Loire, Loiret, and Loireet-Cher

catulisca—The Caturiges were an Alpine tribe3 and
Caesar says that they, as well as the Ceutrones and the Graioceli,

(i, 10, ξ 4). The route which he followed led over Mont
Genevre, thence to Brigantio (Brixiae-on), and thence, most
probably, past Ebrodunuin (Embrun), Caturigae or Caturigo-
magus (Chorgesg. and Vapincum (Gap) to Dea (Die) in the
country of the ocontii (see the note on 10, ἓξ 3-5). He does
not mention any of the towns of the Caturiges. Ebrodunum,
the only one which is mentioned by Ptolemy (ωορκ, iii, 1, ξ 35),
was, according to Strabo (iv, 1, ξ 3), on their western frontier;
but the itineraries mention another, Caturigomagus, and, if
it belonged to them in Caesar's time, their western frontiei· was
almost certainly west of Ebrodunum. If the reader will com·
pare Caesar-'s account of his march with the map, he will see
that they must also have possessed Briganti0‚ though Ptolem
(Geoyffi iii, 1, ξ 36) assigns it to the Segusiani3 unless, indee ‚
the latter, whom Caesar does not notice, were de ndants
(see p. 404) of the Caturiges. Thus the territory of the aturiges

it ought rather to be identified with (alien, about 35 miles
