but why should Caesar have departed‘? Is it likely that he
would have personally led foraging parties *Ρ Long, who refers
eius to hostem, suggests that it 1s a corruption of equitatus,—the
cavalry mentioned in ch. 71. Is it not, however, possible that
eius discessu may be explained by ne autem . . . coyatur (ᾗ 2)‘.³
If Caesar did not write the words, the interpolator was, am
sure, thinki of the following clause.

But even i eius discessu can be explained, what sense is to b‘e
extracted from si ita accidat? As far as Ῑ can see, it could
only mean εἰ ea [i.e. talis multitudo] veniat. But Caesar
would probably have written id, not ita, and certainly he

‘ surrounded ' but ‘ hemmed in ’. The word is occasionally used
in this sense (TI-,alm iii, 1148); but W. Nitsche (Z. G„ 1887.
p. 563) may perhaps be right in conjecturing that Caesar wrote

rations had to be reduced. Ne anatem is a conjecture, pro osed

wise, and their reasons were sound. The ex erience of the
Belgio confederation which opposed Caesar in 5 Β. c, (ii, 10, §4‚
with which cf. iii, 18, ξ 6) had shown that the Gallie organiza-

( § 2.’ amiam-etia Ni perde (Caesar, p. 106) changed this
into Ambarm's, because t e Am arri were intimately connected
with the Aedui (i, 11,§ 4), and, unless they were mentioned
here, were omitted altogether from the list. Mommsen (J. B..
1894, p. 211) adds the reason that the Ambivareti, who, he
says, dwelt near the Menapii (1), could not have been clients
of the Aedui. This curious argument was evidently due to
