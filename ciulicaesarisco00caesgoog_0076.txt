had revised his work : but he wrote very rapidly (viii, Praef„ ξ 6); Ι
and painstaking writers, in revising their manuscript, have osten
detected similar clumsy repetitions, which they had made un·

becomes necessary to insert dux, as Meusel does, after Ovyetorioe.

persuadet is followed not by occu et, but by occupant: the reason
is that persuadet, like deliyitur ξ 3), is historic resent, and is
therefore equivalent to persuasit. Even in Engli some writers,
notably Carlyle, in telling a story, use the present tense instead

 

of the past when they feel that it is more vivid. Stin, Caesar
almost always uses the present subjunctive after the historic
present of verbs of asking and the like,—0rare, meare, imperare,
&a (J. B., 1894, pp. 354-5). After occuparet· one might have

Evidently Catamantaloedis had either been dethroned or
