x HOW CAESAR WROTE THE COMMENTARIES

we are told that they vigorously attacked Quintus Cicero
and in vii, 75, § 3 Caesar says that they were called upon
to contribute 6,ΟΟΟ 111911 to the army which attempted to
relieve Vercingetorix. Again, in vi, 2, ξ 3 Caesar affirms
that ‘ all the Cisrhenane Germans ’‚ who included the
Segni and Condrusi, were in arms against him ε in vi, 31,
§§ 1-2 he implies that these two tribes proved their inno-
cence. ‘But many of the Nervians who fought against
Cicero had doubtless been too young to fight three years
before ; the statement that the tribe was wellnigh exter-
minated may have been only a rhetorical flourish, based
upon misleading reports, which Caesar or his secretary
had not had time or inclination to sift ; and the inconsis-
tency between vi, 2 and vi, 31 only proves that 119 did
not thoroughly revise his work. Even real inconsisten-
cies‚ which are very few, can be accounted for by hasty
use of discordant materials, lapse of memory, or mere
carelessness.

It may be regarded, then, as certain that Caesar wrote
the Commentarios after the campaign of 52 13.0.; and the
only question is whether he wrote them in the winter
following that campaign or later. I am not sure that he
would have had time to write them in the winter; for ’
from the very beginning of 51 he was hard at work, cam-
· paigning against the Bituriges and other tribes, Momm-
sen, indeed, argues (Hist. of Rome, v, 1895, p. 499, n. 1) 1
that the book must have been not only written but pub-
lished before the end of 51, because in vii, 6, ξ 1 Caesar
‘ approves the exceptional laws [passed under the influence
of Pompey] of 702 ’ (52 13.0.), and he could not have done
this after his rupture with Pompey, when he reversed
certain judgements which were based upon those laws.
But why should not the publication have taken place in
50 Β. 0.,-1119 year before that in which the civil war
began? It seems to me most probable that it did, for
this was the only year between Caesar’s first consulship
and the last year of his life in which he was not fighting ;
and, as far as we know, he was 111911 comparatively at
leisu1·e(Gaesar's Conquest of Gaul, pp. 202—10). See p. 436.
