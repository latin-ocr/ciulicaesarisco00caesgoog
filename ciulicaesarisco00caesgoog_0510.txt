414 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX

higher up the Ιιοίιᾙ.1 Everybody now admits that Orleans grew
out of a Gallo-Roman town called Cenabum, for the fact is
proved by the itiner-aries, by the testimony of Ptolemy and
various mediaeval writers, by the discovery of numerous coins,
and by an inscription which was unearthed in 1846 in the
Faubourg St. Vincent at Orleans3 but it has been maintained
{hai} this town was different from the Cenabum mentioned
aesar.
yThe principal arguments that have been brought against the
orthodox view are that Caesar, marching from A edincnm
(Sene) to relieve Gorgobina (vii, 9, ξ ὃς 10, ξ 4), w ich was
probably between the Allier and the Loire, would not have
one so far out of his way as Orleans ; that the distance from
{rleans to Gergovia is considerably more than 160 Roman
miles, which, according to Caesar (3, ξ 3)‚was the distance from
Cenabum to the country of the Arverni 3 that Orleans is not on
a hill, whereas Gallie stron holds generally were; and that
Caesar would not have been a le to march from Sens to Crleans
in four days,—the time which he says that it took him to
march from Agedincum to Cenabum (11,§ 1-5). All these

first of all, t e Carnutes, who had been the first to rebel, and
who, by the massacre of Roman citizens, had out d the
majesty of Rome (2; 3, ξ 1; 17, ξ 7; 28, ξ 4). Besi es, how
can we tell that, east of Orleans‚ any bridge spanned the Loire
in that part of its course which crossed Caesar-’s line of march,
or that, if there were bridges, Vercingetorix had not destroyed
them (see 34, ξ 3) ⁴? Secondly, one cannot be sure that Caesar's
estimate of the distance from Cenabum to the country of the
Arverni was exactly right, or that when he said ‘the country
of the Arverni’ (3, ἲ 3) he meant Ger via. Thirdly‚ some of
the Gallio strongho ds-for instance, varicum and Lutecia—
were not built upon hille, and we ma gether both from
Caesar's narrative (3, ξ 1 ; 11,§§ 4-9) and rom Strabo (iv, 2, ξ 3)
that Cenabum was rather a trading town than a stronghold.
1f it had been really strong, is it likely that the Carnutes would
have run away without making the s ightest attempt to stand
a siege? Lastly, the distance from Sene to Orleans by the
longest road was not more than 81 miles; and Caesar gives us
to understand (11‚§ 3) that he was making haste. The distance
by the shortest road was only about 67 miles.
The arguments sor identifying Cenabum with Gien are
hardly worth mentioning: they really amount to this, that if

¹ Many of the antiquarios who refused to identify Cenabum with
Orleans maintained that it stood on high ground at Gien-le·Vieux,
which is about a mile and a quarter north-west of Gien. But, as
the words oppedum Cenabum pons fluminis Μῃονὶς contumeliae (vii, 11,
ξ 6) prove, the town was in actual contact with the bridge. The
antiquarios were therefore compelled to assume that it extended
from Cion-le·Vieux right down to the banks of the river. This
imaginary Cenabum would have been far lar-ger than any other
Gallie town.
