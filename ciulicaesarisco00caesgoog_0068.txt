emigration; bought up wagons and draught cattle; and laid
in large supplies of corn. But in Italy there was a states·
man ready to checkmate them.

One of the consuls for the year 59 was Julius Caesar.
About the time of the election Ariovistus, who had
already paid court to Caesar’s predecessor, MetelluS, made
overtures for an alliance with Rome; and doubtless with
the object of securing his neutrality in view of the
threatened Helvetian invasion, the Senate conferred upon
him the title of Friend of the Roman People. They had
already half promised to protect their Gallio allies. They
now practically guaranteed to the conqueror of those
allies the security of his conquest. And in this latter
policy Caesar, if we may believe his own word,¹ fully
concurred. He must have seen the impending troubleS.
But he was not yet free to encounter them; and he
doubtless approved of any expedient for keeping the
barbarian chief inactive until he could go forth in person
to confront him. That time was at hand. In the year
of his consulship Caesar was made Governor of Illyricum,
or Dalmatia, and of Gaul, that is to say of Gallia Cisalpina,
or Piedmont and the Plain of Lombardy, and of Gallia
Braccata, or, as it was usually called, the Province. If
Suetonius ² was rightly informed, his commission gave
him the right to include Gallia Comata-‘ the land of the
long-haired Gauls ’--that is to say the whole of inde-
pendent Gaul north of the Province, within his sphere of
action.³ As he assumed the responsibility of invading
Britain als0, it may be well to say a few words about
the people whom he found there. 'Phe primitive life

³ It has been objected (Athenaeum, Jan. 13, 1900, p. 42) that ‘in
another passage (Gram., c. 3) Suetonius applies the expression
“Gallia Comata'' to a portion [only] of Transalpino Gaul '.
Suetonius (ed. C. 1.. Roth, p. 289, l. 23) there says that ‘Munatius
PlancuS, when he was Governor of Gallia Comata, founded Lug-
dunum ' (Munatius Plancus, cum Galliam regeret Comatam, Luydtmum
condidit), which surely does not prove that the Province could
properly be called Gallia Comata. Still Suetonius may have used
the expression incorrectly.
