in alia omnia tmnse'it. This was a technical expression
(discessit being sometimes used, as in Cicero, Fam.. x, 12, ξ 3,
instead of transiit) and meant ‘rejected the motion ⁹. See the

first note on 52, ξ 5.

§2 necessitates probably means the same as necessitudines,
which indeed is the reading of Sfi. It has been interpreted,
wrongl in my opinion, as meaning ⁴ methods of compulsion '.

54, §y 1. bellum Parthicum. Three years before (53 Ec.) the
Parthians had inflicted a disastrous defeat upon the triumvir,
Crassus, in the battle of Carrhae; but the Senate had no inten-
tion of avenging this defeat. The senatus consultum was a mere
prgtexgzt for requiring Caesar to sui-render two legions. cf. B. 0.,
1 , .
⁹ §25 leyionem primam . . . Caesaris. cf. vi, 1, §§ 2-4. This,
as I have shown in the note on viii, 4, 3, was most probably
the legion which, while it remained un er Gaesar’s command,
was known as the 6th.

3. suorum would have been in order if dubitaret had pre-
ce e? it instead of dubium esset. As it is, eius would be more
re u ar.

{uo nomina—‘on his own account': that is to say, he dis·
patched this legion as one which he had not bon-owed, but had
raised himself. The phrase is used in a similar but somewhat
extended sense in vii, 75, ξ 5.
