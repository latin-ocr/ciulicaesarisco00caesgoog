there were two Roman roads in the valley of the Dora Riparia,
one on the lest bank and the other on the right. He asserts
that there were, and that mile-stones found between 'Purin and
Susa prove it. I can find no evidence for his assertion; and
Mommsen (0.1. L„ v, pars ii, pp. 811-12 denies it. Mommsen
points out, further, that, according to t e anonymous eogra-
pher of Ravenna (ed. M. Parthey and G. Pinder‚ p. 255, 1-3),
Ad Fines and Ocelum were on the same rond, the former being
nearer to Turin. He concludes that these two towns'were very
close to 01123 ὁητιὲξὴετς and this much at all events is certain

Haedui.-'I'his tribe was so called by Caesar ; but as the form
Aedui is more familiar, we may use it except when we are quot-
ing from Gaesar's book. 'l'he territory of the Aedui comprised
the dioceses of Autun (Au todunnm), chalon-sur·Saone (Ga-
villonum), Macen (Matiscoijwand Nevers (Noviodunum). This
territory corresponded wit the departments of the Saone-et-
Loire and Nievre and parts of the Oete-d'Or and the Allier. A
mile-stone erected in A. D. 259 at the distance of 72 Roman miles
from Augustodunum on the road to Autessiodurum (Auxerre)
stood, as we learn from the inscription which it bears, Aeduorum
finibus, and was also in the territory that belonged to the civitas
Autessiodurum. Therefore, if Desjardins is right in saying that
Aeduorum finibus means ‘in the country of the Aedui ', in
ΑΛ). 259, if not in the time of Caesar, the Aedui also possessed
the Auxerrois. Desjardins argues that unless finibus means
‘ territory ', the diocesan boundary does not represent the boun·
dary between the imperial civitates, Autessiodurum and A usto·
dunum; but Mommsen (0.I.L., xiii, pars 2, fasc. 2, p. 6 2) is
probably right in holding that finibus is here equivalent to con-
finio (C. G„ . 351-3‚ 473 [here modifiedD.

Helvii— his tribe (vii, 7, ᾗ 5) possessed the Vivarais, which
&cili-ms the ⁴1²giguthern part of the department of the Ardeche
( Illyricum extended east of the Adriatic, as far southward as
Epirus and Macedonia and eastward as far as Moesia.

(Portus) Itium—Between Dieppe and Ghent there is not a
harbour, a roadstead, or a fishing-port which has not been at
one time or another during the last four centuries identified
with Portus Itius. But the reader will be quite safe in ignor-ing
almost all of them. Caesar had ascertained before he embarked
for Britain in 54 ΒΛ). that Portus Itius was the most convenient
startin -point for his fleet, which numbered over 800 small craft
(v, 235 ; 8, ξ 6) z he sailed from it to the eastern coast of Kent,
certainly north of Walmer and almost certainly between San-
down Gastle and Sandwich (see the note on iv, 23, 6) ; and he
reckoned the length of the passage at about 30 man miles
(v, 2, ξ 3). It has been said that any such calculation, made
before the time of scientific map-making‚ was worthless3 but in
the twelfth century an Arab eographer estimated the distance
between Wissant and Englancgl correctly, and early in the seven·
teenth century Kentish seamen told the German geo ra her,
Cluver, that the run from Dover to Boulogne was 2 ng-
lish miles,-an estimate which erred by less than a mile (A.B.,
