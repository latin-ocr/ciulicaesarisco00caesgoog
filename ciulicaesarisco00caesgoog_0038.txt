xxxii THE ETHNOLOGY OF· GAUL

had dwelt east of the Rhine3 and if Caesar called them
Germani in a special sense, as distinct from the rest of
the Belgae, the explanation may be that they were the
latest immigrant& It seems unlikely that· they, alone
among the Belgio tribea, learned Celtic in Gaul. If they
did, they must have learned it from Celts whom they
conquered or among whom they settled; and if so,
they must have been unaccompanied by women (see
p. xxviii) and inferior in numbers to the Celtic peoples
whom they subdued, and who, with them, formed the
‘Cisrhenane Geimans’.¹ The Atuatuci, indeed, were
really of German origin if, as is generally believed, the
Cimbri and Teutoni, from whom they were descended‚²
were Germane ; but their ancestors were apparently left
in Gaul without women.

And now we have come to our final question,—the
relationship between the Celts and the Germana. The
reader will understand that by ‘the Celts’ I mean not
only the invaders who had conquered the country between
the Seine and the Garonne but also the Belgae. We
have seen that when the Celts invaded Gaul they
already spoke Celtic; but there is good reason to believe
that their pred eminant physical type differed little, if at
all, from that of the Germans. The ancient writers
unanimously describe the two peoples in terms which
are virtually the same. The Germane, like the ossula,
were tall and fair: that is the sum and substance of their
evidence. The Germana whom they described were,
moreover, like the Celts, a long-headed race. 1 am,
indeed, inclined to believe that in the time of Caesar
the purest Celts and the purest Germans, although· both
were tall and fair and long-headed‚ differed from one
another; and my reasons are these. Among our Celtic-
speaking fellow citizens are to be found numerous speci·
mens of a type which also exists in those parts of Brittany
that were colonized by invaders from Britain and in those
parts of Gaul in which the Celtic invaders appear to have
settled most thickly‚ as well as in Northern Italy, which
was once occupied by Gauls3 and this type, even among
