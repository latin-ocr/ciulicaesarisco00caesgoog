10 Quae civitates commodius suam rem publicam 20 Unauthor-

quis quid de re publica a finitimis rumore aut fama political

acceperit, uti ad magistratum deferat neve cum quo {pagor-

alio communicet, quod saepe homines temerarios 2
15 atque imperitos falsis rumoribus terreri et ad facinus
impelli et de summis rebus consilium capere cognitum

quae minus commode suam rem publicam administrare existi-
mantur) were prone to do the rash things which the authorities
of the ‘ comparatively well governed' tribes guarded against.

ξ 3. per concilium means something more than in coneilio,—
