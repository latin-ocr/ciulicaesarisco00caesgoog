COMMENTARIUS Ι 57

velle se de iis rebus quae inter eos agi coeptae neque
perfectae essent agere cum eo: uti aut iterum con-
loquio diem constitueret aut, si id minus vellet, ex
suis legatis aliquem ad se mitteret.

eius diei Germani retineri non potuerant quin tela

neque is evidently equivalent to neque tamem-³ but not ⁹.

uti . . . mitteret. I do not know any other instance in which
Glaesar uses uti or ut to introduce an imperative or admonitory
c ause.

§2 pridie eius diei is bracketed by Meusel (J. B„ 1910, p. 45) on
the ground that it contradicts Biduo post in the preceding
sentence ; but (supposin that the common translation of biduo
post is right) is it not as ikely that Caesar was careless as that
a {sager wrote a misleading note in the margin ⁶? cf. Ph„ 1863,
p ξ 3. Meusel (J. B„ 1910, pp. 55-6) deletes ex suis, on the
ground that, following ex suis leyatis aliquem ad se mitteret in
ξ 1, leqatum ex suis could only mean Ieyatum ex suis leyatis,
which, he says, is impossible. I think, however, that Caesar
wrote ex suis in contrast to 0. Valerium Procillum (who was not
a Roman, but a provincial) in 4 ; and I find that Klotz (G.S.,

p. 238, n. 1) agrees with me, t ough he would alter legatis in ·

§ 1 into leyatum.

esset. 'l’he subjunctive is used because Caesar was not stating
a fact, but expressing a thought which had passed through his
mind. Thus quod . . . eausa non esset is equivalent to quod, ut
Caesari videbatur . . . causa mm erat.

hospitio. By the Roman institution called hospitium privatum

ments were concluded between individual Roman citizens

and individual foreigners,under which the former were entitled
to receive hospitality from the latter. It has been remarked
that this practice must have been very useful in places
where the accommodatiori of inns was not available (D. S.. iii,
298-9). Provincials upon whom the members of a governor’s
