Belgium, and Seuthem Helland. The people were
divided into three groups, differing, so Caesar tells us, in
race, language, manners, and institutione. Between the
Garonne and the Pyrenees were the Aquitani. North-
east of the Seine and the Marne, in the plains of Picardy,
Artois, and champagne, on the mist-ladon flats of the
Scheldt and the lower Rhine and in the vast forest of
the Ardennes, dwelt the Belgae, who may have partially
mixed and were continually at war with their German
neighbours. The lowlands of Switzerland, Alsace, Lor-
raine, and part of the Rhenish Provinces, the great plains
and the uplands of central France, and the Atlantic sea-
board, were occupied by the Celtae.

Modern science‚ however, has established a more precise Prehistory
classification. During the last fifty years the classical of ⁶⁸⁰¹·
texts, which were once the only source of knowledge,
have been supplemented by geological, archaeological,
and anthropological research 3 and it has become possible
to reconstruct the prehistory, the very existence of which
had hardly been suspected, of every European land.
Skeletons have yielded information about the physical
characters of the people ε their implements and weapons,
their clothing and ornaments, their art, and even their
religion, have been revealed by relies extracted from the
river-drift, from caverns and sepulchres, from villageS,
hill-forts, and buried hoards. The Celts were but the
latest invaders of Gau13 and their life was profoundly
influenced by the Ligurians, the Iberiaus, and the name·
less tribes who, during countless millenniums, had dwelt
in Gaul before them. The earliest belonged to the
Quaternary Period, which included the Great Iee Age;
and the time, incalculably long, during which they and
their fellows in Britain and on the Continent existed,
is known as the Palaeolithic, or Old Stone, Age. They
saw the volcanoes of Auvergne, which during countless
centuries have slumbered, belching forth flame and dis-
charging lava: mammoths and rhinocerosea lions, bears,
and hyenas, bisons, gluttons, wolves were their fellows3
and over the vast expanse of the forest-cumbered land,
where they roamed in quest of food, there was no sign,
