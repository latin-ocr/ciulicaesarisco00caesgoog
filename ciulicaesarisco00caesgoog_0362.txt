p. 208) regards tuendi causa as an inte 161106, and explains
eo as referring to Vellaunodunum. As i the Carnutes were 60
quixotically unselfish as 10 collect troops for the protection
of a town which belonged 10 another tribe! But Meusel
(3113, 1910, P2533 1912, gip. 71-2) insiste that Mommsen was

prae-sidium had been collected for the defence of Cenabum,
Caesar would not have added the words quod eo mitterent,
and cum lonyius . . . existimarent would be meaningless. The
Carnutes, 116 6(1(16, 116(1 60 sear for Cenabum: otherwise they
would have long before taken steps 10 defend it, and they would
have assembled their troops in Cenabum itself, not 61 any other
place with the object of sending them to Cenabum. 1 fear that
this defence will not avail Mommsen. Certainly the Carnutes
had promised 10 6111116 1116 first blow, and they had fulfilled
their promise by murdering Roman citizens: but that was
a very different thin from sendin an army 0111 of their own

supposition that the Carnffites fancied that they could, by ’111611

Vellaunodunum is out of e question. As 10 1116 words
eo mitterent, if it were necessary 10 bracket anything, 1 would
bracket them; but they yield perfect sense: the praesidium
could not be raised at Cenabum itself3 it was raised piecemeal
in different parts of the country, and sent to Cenabum. The
Carnutes could hardly have expected that, after the ou
which they had committed, they would be left 1161110166 ;
but, believing that the siege of Vellaunodunum would be
protracted, they had delayed preparing to defend themselves.
