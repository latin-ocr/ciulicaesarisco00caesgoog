28 DE BELLO GALLICO

Gallia citeriore proxime conscripserat et omnia auxilia

compleret3 impedimenta sarcinasque in unum locum

that composed it may have been directed against one or both
of the enemy's flanks or on his rear. It is the second question
that has most perplexed the commentatore. Rudolf Schneider
has tried ιο prove that as soon as the light-armed auxiliaries
had done their work and hand-to·hand fightin had begun, the
second line was regularly incorporated with t e first. But in
the battle with the Helvetii the auxiliaries were sar removed
from the fighting line: if, then, the second line was from the
commencement of the battle incorporated with the first, why
was it formed at all, and what was the sense of the expression
triplicem aciem *Ρ It is clear from Caesar's narrative (25, ' 7) that
even after the first stage of close fighting was over the rst two
lines still remained distinct. My own belief is that the second
line as well as the third acted as a reserve3 that if and when
the first line needed support, the second was incorporated with
it, and occasionally perhaps the third also. In the first stage
of the battle each cohort of the first line probably formed a
separate group: it would have been dangerous for the enemy
to attempt ιο penetrate the spaces between the groups, for the
would have been liable ιο be attacked and cut off by the fres
cohorte in reserve ς and, on the other hand, these could advance
when they were wanted into the spaces and reinforce the first
line. It is not my business ιο give reasons for this opinion
here3 for in dein so 1 should have to discuss many passages
which are not in gaesar’s text: but the whole problem‚ which
is interesting, is thoroughly worked out in 0. G„ p . 588—99.

ἓξ 2-3. in summo ἑτερο . . . sarcinasque. 'Phe fis. reading,
which is untranslatable, is (ipse interim . . . veteranorum) ita uti
supra se [v.l.sed] in summo iuqo . . . auaeilia conlocari, ac totum
montem hominibus compleri et interea sarcinas (in unum locum . . .
iussit). An attempt has been made to amend this by changin
conlocari and compleri into conlocaret and compleret. Mense
deletes ita uti supra se and brackets ac totum . . . interea, which,
as Klotz remarks (0.S., p. 239), is a desperate remedy. I have
adopted Klotz's conjecture, which is at all events ingenious.
Flortunately the general sense of the passage is in any case
c ear.

§3. sarcinas means the bundles §analogous to knapsacks)
which the soldiers carried (see p. xv). Accordingly Stoffel
supposes that the heavy ba e (impedimenta), whlch, as the
reader will have gathered om the preceding note. is not
mentioned in the MSS.. had been sent on under a small escort
to Bibracte. But we should have e ected Caesar ιο tell us
this. Moreover‚ as his army remaine on or near the battle·
field sor three days aster the victory (26, ἕξ 5-6), it seems
reasonable ιο su pose that they must have wanted some of their
heavy baggage. n the other hand, as only two days' rations were
left (233 1), the baffigage-cattle may have been sent to Bibracte
to fetch corn. 'l' e entrenchment on the hill of Armecy
