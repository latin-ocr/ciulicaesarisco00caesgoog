THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL xxiii

oval headS. Probably the latter were descended from
the palaeolithic race which is represented by the skele-
tous of Chancelade and LaugerieBasse3 but the round·„
headed people, as would appear from the places in which
their remains were most numerouS, migrated into Gaul
by two routes,—through Belgium and Savoy. People
who resembled the long-heads of the Lozere dwelt in the
Neolithic Age in our own island and in various parts of
Central and Southern Europe: the round-heads were rare
in Britain, but numerous on the Continent, as they are
still. '

It must not, however, be supposed that all the neolithic
inhabitants of Gaul belonged to one or the other of these
two main types. Here and there long-headed individuale
were tall; and in some places skeletons of divers kinds
have been found jumbled together. But although the
two principal groups gradually intermiugled, they were
certainly at first distinct 3 for of 140 interments 55 con·
tained only long skuIIS, and 20 only short ones 3 while
every one of the skulls-54 in aH—that were taken from
the eaverns of l'Homme Mort and Baumes·0haudes were
long.

Invaders different from the people who have just been
described may have settled in Gaul in the Bronze Age Α
but we cannot be sure, for in that period the dead were
more often cremated than interred. At a later time,
when iron weapons were beginning to be used instead of
bronze, a tall race‚ which, as far as we ean judge from
skeletons, resembled the Celts, occupied the eastern
departments of the J ura and the Doubs3 and they were
most probably new-comem.

In Switzerland—the original home of the Helvetii—the
long-headed and the round-headed group were both
represented. ,

Ι must now say a few words about the Ligurians andR
the Iberians, who inhabited Gaul before the Celts arrived.
Before 500 nc. the Ligurians possessed South-Eastern
Gaul, east of the Rhene and at least as far north as
Bellegarde in the department of 'the Ain; and at that
time or not long afterwards they were mingled, west of
