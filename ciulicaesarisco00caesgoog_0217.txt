COMMENTARIUS IIII 139

mitteret, oportunissima res accidit, quod postridie
eius diei mane eadem et perfidia et simulatione usi
Germani frequentes, omnibus principibus maiori·
busque natu adhibitis, ad eum in castra venerunt,

atque esset dictum et ipsi petissent, proelium pridie
commisissent, simul ut, si quid possent, de indutiis
fallendo impetrarent. Quos sibi Caesar oblatos 6
gavisus illos retineri iussit; ipse omnes copias castris
10 eduxit equitatumque, quod recenti proelio perter-
ritum esse existimabat, agmen subsequi iussit.

Ἧοά. In English the force of quod (= ‘ namely that ') can be
best given by breaki up the sentence: ‘a most fortunate
event occurred. Next ay early in the morning ’‚ διο.

ξ 5. sui puryandv‘. See the note on iii, 6, ξ 1.

quod . . . commistssssent is not a remark made by Caesar, but
expresses the gist of what was said by the Germans: therefore
the subjunctive is used. In regard to the force of quod, see the
note on 22, ξ l (quod . . .fecissent).

‘Phe long sentence contained ιιι ξξ.4-5 is one of the many

two translate simul, ut dicebatur . . . impetraveram—⁶ Their
ostensible object was to clear themselves from complicity in the
attack which had taken place the day before contrary to
the agreement which they had themselves asked ἴοις at the
same time they intended,' διο.

ξ 6. illos may at first sight seem superfluous ; but the sentence
would not be so strong without it. As Schneider says, if Caesar
had remained in camp, he could not have written illos retineri
iussit, ipse castris se tenuit3 but illos retineri iussit is contrasted
with i omnes copias castris eduxit.

14, 1. 1 need hardly say that, as the word cymen in 13, 6
shows, the army mar-chad against the Germane in three paral el
gqlumgg, ξυὶιιὶοὶι, on approaching the camp, wheeled into line.

· 1, ‚ ·

prius . . . possent. See the note on iii, 26, ξ 3. Here a pur·
pose is hinted at.

ξ 2. omnibus mbas, which is explained by et celeritate . . .
suorum, is an adverbial phrase and might be translated by
‘completely ’. Cf. iii, 17, ξ 5.
