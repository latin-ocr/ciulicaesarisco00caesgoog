Now for the fibulae. Commentators have argued about them
for 400 years3 but 6 young architeot‚ Mr. Stanley Han, 1166
reeently solved the problem. To examine 611 1116 theories would

by the words disclusis and revinctis to have been produced not
by the fibulae alone but 6166 by 6 1ἰ6. The fibulae, in his opinion,
were iron ‘do ⁹, such as 616 universally used now. They 616
shaped somew 61 like 6 broad 61 eroquet-hoop, and 616
about 12 inehes across, with the en s bent 61 ri ht angles and
pointed. ’They‘ would have been fixed diagon ly, one of·the

self, though 1 shall add 6 few words in brackets. Referring to
the diagram, 116 remarks that ‘since the points B and O 616
made fast [by the fibulae} the whole structure ABCD will tend
[owing to the ourrent] to take up the position AB'C'D, and the ¹
effect of this will be to lengthen the distance between A and C. 1
