158 DE BELLO GALLICO

liis uti consuerunt, reliquis copiis subsecuti nostros

2 navibus egredi prohibebant. Erat ob has causas
summa difficultas, quod naves propter magnitudinem
nisi in alto constitui non poterant, militibus autem,
ignotis locis, impeditis manibuS, magno et gravi onere 5
armorum oppressis simul et de navibus desiliendum
et in fluctibus consistendum et cum hostibus erat

3 pugnandum, cum illi aut ex arido aut paulum in
aquam progressi omnibus membris expeditis, notis-
simis locis, audacter tela coicerent et equos insuefactos 10

4 incitarent. Quibus rebus nostri perterriti atque huius
omnino generis pugnae imperiti, non eadem alacritate
ac studio quo in pedestribus uti proeliis consuerant
utebantur.

many as in Franco. Yet the Gauls had evidently ceased to use
them before the time of Caesar ; for he never mentions them in
describing his Gallie campaigns. Professor Ridgeway has

they began to import animale powerful enough to big
men and to charge with effect. British hei-ses, as we now
from the skeletons that have been unearthed, were for the most
gart no bigger than ponies. It is a popular delusion that the

ritish chariots had scythes (A. Β., pp. 342-3‚ 674-6).

ξ 2. militibus autem . . . desiliendum. This assage has need·
lessly perplexed some commentatore, one o whom actually
suggested that the unhappy soldiers were obliged to walk
several paces under water! They forgot that the ships’ bows
may have projeoted considerably‚ and also that when they were
run aground they would have been buried for a considerable
depth. Thus it would have been possible to jump into four feet
six inehes or five feet of water from the bow of a ship whose
draught was a good deal more.

ξ 3. insuefactos. Ι infer that the horses had been exercised on
the beach in anticipation of Caesar’s invasion.

25, ξ 1. ad usum. Schneider is, 1 think, mistaken in saying
that these words were added simply for the sake of rhythm. lf
Caesar had merely written expeditior, his apparent meaning
would have been that the galleys were faster than the trans·
ports. But they were not only faster: they were also ⁴ more free
from impediment' (eapeditior) for all purposes of navigation
(ad usum, which is equivalent to ad uomendum—in the widest
sense); in other words, they were easier to turn and to stop,
