only consider what ιε ιο be said for that one,—V1Uate, near
Neu -sur-Barangeon. Villate is on the Roman road from
Cena um to Avaricum; and though it is only 18 miles from
Bourges, Caesar probably marched a much greater distance, in
order to avoid the foreste on the north and the marshes which

have said that Vercingetorix had followed him by easy stages
(minoribus itineribus). Celtic remeius, Roman coins belon '
to the period comprised between the reigns of Augustus an
Gratian, and the ruins of a building which is supposed to have
been a Gallo-Roman theatre have been discovered at Villate.
All this, indeed, only shows that Villate may have been Novio·
dunum 3 but as every conceivable site seems to have been
proposed, and as there is more to be said for Villate than for
any other, 1 mark Noviodunum there on the map with a note of
interrogation (Ο. G„ pp. 459-64).

Noviodunum (Haeduorum).-—Although direct evidence is
wanting, this town undoubtedly stood upon the site of Nevers.
Caesar (vii, 55, ξ 1) sim ly describes it as ‘ advantageously situ·

writers with Noviodunum: unless Noviodunum penshed‚ which,
as it was a most important place, is hardly conceivable, it was
certainly Nivernnm, because there was no other Gallo-Roman
town with which Noviodunum can be identified; and the great
