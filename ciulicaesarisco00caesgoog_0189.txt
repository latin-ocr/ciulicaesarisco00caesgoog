COMMENTARIUS ΙΙΙ 111

Erant eius modi fere situs oppidorum ut posita 12 His fruit-

in extremis lingulis promunturiisque neque pedibus
aditum haberent, cum ex alto se aestus incitavisset,
quod [bis] accidit semper horarum XII spatio, neque
6 navibua quod rursus minuente aestu naves in vadis
adflictarentur. Ita utraque re oppidorum oppugnatio 2
impediebatur. Ac si quando magnitudine operis forte 3
superati, extruso mari aggere ac molibus atque his
oppidi moenibus adaequatis, suis fortunis desperare
10 coeperant, magno numero navium adpulso, cuius rei
summam facultatem habebant, omnia sua deportabant
seque in proxima oppida recipiebant: ibi se rursus 4

12, ξ 1. linyule's ptumum-acriisque. Here again, as in 3, ξ 1,
Caesar defines the sense in which he uses one word by adding
another. By adding pumuntur-iisque he shewed what the rela-
tion of the ⁴ spits’ (limiae) was to the mainland ; and if he had
written pmmumm'ae‘e alone, his meaning would not have been
completely expressed, for a headland may be of any shape.
laSth’ or headlands ' would, 1 think, be an adequate trans·

ion.

cum . . . incitavimt. As we have seen in the note on i, 25,
ξ 3, when Caesar uses cum in describing repeated action, he
general] couples it with the indicative, as in 15, ξ 1 (cimm-
steterunt. The subjunctive, as Meusel remarks (J. B„ 1894,

. 371), may be explained here and in 13, ξ 9 by Attraction of
{leod} for the cum-clause is dependent uffin an nce-clause.

bis rs, 1 need hardly sa ‚ contrary to t. May we suppose
that Caesar wrote hic? l find that this con'ecture has been
made already (H. Meusel, L. C.. iii [Tab. enicet„ p. 121).
Kraner, referring to Pliny, Nat. Hm„ ii, 97, ξ 212, ts over
the difficulty by adopting an old emendation,—XXII 1 instead
of XII. Caesar mentioned the tides because in the Mediter-
ranean they are hardly perceptible.

As any one will see who reads the sentence attentively,
adflictat-entur does not mean ‘were injured’, but ‘would be
injured ⁹ : quod . . . afflictarentur is equivalent to quod timendum
fuit ne . . . naves in vadis adfiictamneur.

ξ 3. aqam ac ηοοῑῶιισ. t seems to me that aqam denotes
the material of the structure, which in this case must have
been princi ally stone, and molibus the structure itsclf. In
Β. 0., i, 25, 5 Caesar calls the mole which he constructed in
the hai-bour of Brundisium in order to bar the exit of Pompey’s
ships, moles atque yet-em: in aletter to Cicero (Λεὼ, ix, 14,§ 1)
he calls it moles oilly.

his . . . adamatis. Schneider takes his as an instrumental
ablative and adaequatis as agreeing with moenibuc3 but Meusel
(L. 0., ii, (330) makes adaequatis agree with hie, and takes moeni·
bus as dative. of course the question of fact remains unaffected.
