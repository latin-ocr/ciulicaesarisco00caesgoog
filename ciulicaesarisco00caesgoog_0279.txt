L. Roscio. Mommsen (J. B„ 1894, p. 206) adds quaestori,
remarking that if quaestoribus e (25, ξ 5) is right, the title
uaestor must have been omitte with one name in 24, and that
Roscius is designated as a quaestor in 53, § 6. Mommsen is, not
itffprokallssy’ right ; but Cicero is not called a leqatus by Caesar,
ou e was one.

ingRemis . . . mmmmm. If Caesar's narrative is correct,
Labienus was still in the country of the Remi towards the end
of 54 Β. ο.; for Caesar says (53, §2) that Indutiomarus, who
had been on the oint of attacking Labienus, returned into the
country of the 'll’reveri (copias omnes in Trevems reducit). In
vi, 5, ξ 6, however, Caesar says that he sent the baggage of the
whole army into the country of the Treveri to Labienus, and in
vi, 7, ξ l he says that the Treveri were preparing to attack
Labienus and the legion which was wintering 1n their territory:
but he does not say that Labienus had transferred his camp
from the country of the Remi to that of the Treveri; and
Napoleon 111 argues that Labienus must have remained through-
out the winter m his original camp, because, after the destruc·
tion of Sabinus’s force (v, 26-37), it would have been very
dangerous for him to move. Most probably, then, the camp
was really in the country of the Treveri, thou h it was very
near the common frontier of the Remi and t e Treveri (in
confinio Treverorum) ; and we ma suppose that in vi, 5 and 7
Caesar corrected the mistake w 'ch he had made in v, 24
(C. G„ pp. 732-4).

ξ 4. Unam leyionem . . . misit. This legion, as we learn from
vi, 32, §§ 3-4, eneam ed at a place called Atuatuca, the
geographical osition of which is discussed on pp. 407-8. The
positione of a the other camps have of course been guessed
at; but, except that os Trebonius, which was at Samarobriva
(Amicus) (ch. 46-7; C. G„ p. 371, n. 1), not one of them is
known. See, however, the note on vi, 7, ᾗ 5.

The mention of the five cohorts which formed part of
Sabinus's force has caused some perplexity. We know that
Caesar had at least eight legions in 54 Β. ο.; for when he
entered Gaul he had four (i, 7‚§ 23 10‚§ 3): he raised two
more in the same year (i, 10, ξ 3), and two more in the year
following (ii, 2, ξ 1). We may be sure, however, that he had
not only eight but nine in 54 B.0.; for proxime in §4 of the
chapter which we are reading means nuper, as it does in
