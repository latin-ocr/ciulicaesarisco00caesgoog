COMMENTARIUS V 21⁷

fidem praestiterat. Hic servo spe libertatis magnis· 3
que persuadet praemiis ut litteras ad Caesarem deferat.
Has ille in iaculo inligatas effert et Gallus inter Gallos 4
sine ulla suspicione versatus ad Caesarem pervenit.
5 Ab eo de periculis Ciceronis legionisque cognoscitur. 5

Caesar acceptis litteris hora circiter XI. diei statim 46 caesar

nuntium in Bellovacos ad M. Crassum quaestorem &affliges

mittit, euius hiberna aberant ab eo milia passuum resono,
XXV; iubet media nocte legionem proficisci celeriter· 2
10 que ad se venire. Exit cum nuntio Crassus. Alterum 3
ad C. Fabium legatum mittit, ut in Atrebatium fines
legionem adducat, qua sibi iter faciendum sciebat.
Scribit Labieno, si rei publicae commodo facere poaeit, 4
cum legione ad fines Nerviorum veniat. Reliquam
15 partem exercitus, quod paulo aberat longius, non
putat expectandam ; equites circiter CCCC ex proximis
hibernis cogit.

. . . perfuyerat mean ‘who since the beginning of the blockade
had been as a deserter (perfuga) with Cicero . Ι believe that
Lange is over-subtle and that a prima obsidione does mean ‘ im·
mediately aster the beginning of the blockade '. Cf. L. 0., i, 41.

§3. Μαρκίας praemiis, sa s J. Lange (N. J„ clv, 1897, p. 613),
means ⁴ by the promise of ιιι-ᾖε rewards ', for of course the slave
was not paid ιιι advance. e may, indeed, have demanded
a sum down before he started, for in iii, 18, ξ 2 and 26, ξ 1
praemiis pollicitationibanue must surely mean ‘rewards and

romises’ (of further reward): but Lange's view is supported
By 55, ξ 3 and i, 44, § 2, where Ariovistus says that he non siue
'Zuqnin spe magisque praemiis donum . . . reliquias& and 1 believe
t at e is ri .

ξ 4. iaculi The reading of a is in iacu103 but supposing
that it is right, in must mean ‘on’z for if, as Long suggests
(D. R. R„ iv, 227), the letter was inserted in the hollowed shast
of a javelin lashing (inliyatas) was obviously both superfluous
and impossible. The letter could easily have been concealed by
lasbin twine over it, as if the javelin had been spliced.

46, 2. cum nuntio does not mean ‘ along with the messenger ⁹
(that, if it were true, would be a superfluous piece of information)‚
but ⁴ on the arrival of the messenger ⁹.

ξ 4. commodo is ablative. cf. i 35, ξ 4.

ccco. This was a very amali number (cf. s, ξς 1-2). we
may infer from the present passage, as well as from the passages
(iv, 6, ξ 5; vi, 4, § 6) which show that Caesar regularly lev1ed
contingente of cavalry from the various Gallie tribes in the
{zzzss’fslffistffl’Qhffffg‘zt'z'sffitssffiffi ffssfflffiffi
remained with the legions.
