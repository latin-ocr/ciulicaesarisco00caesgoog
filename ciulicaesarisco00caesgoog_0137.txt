distinguish P. Crassus from his father (21, ξ 4), who, with
Caesar and Pompey‚ formed the first triumvirate‚ and from his
elder brother (v, 24, § 3), who was one of Caesar’s quaestore in
54 nc. But would not Caesar’s contemporary readers have
already been aware of the distinction ⁶? M. J ullian remarks
that Caesar does not apply the word· to certain other well-
known] officers whose fathers were still livi ; and aecor ingly
he argues that Crassus was called adulescens ecause he had not
attained the age of 30‚—the lowest at which a man was eligible
for the post of quaestor. M. Jullian ma be right: but
adulescens was a word of elastie meaning, an Cicero (Phia, ii,
46, ξ 118) spoke of himself as having been an adulescens when
he was 43. Cicero generally expresses ‘the younger ' by minem
but in Act„ jin 18, ᾗ 1 adulescens Curio probably means ‘the
yoggggrlquaenes . . . verterunt. We have seen (51-,§ 2) that,
before the battle, the Germane closed their rear w1th a semi-
circle of wagons‚ ‘to do away with all ho e of escape.’ Yet
they now fled. Frontinus (ii, 3, ξ 6) exp ains this apparent

regarded as an arm of the Rhine; but this is unlikely, for
when Caesar spoke of the Rhenus in 54, ξ 1 he certainly meant
the main stream of the Rhine. May we suppose that some of
