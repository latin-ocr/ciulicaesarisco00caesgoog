IN TRODUGTION

Tnnssr. centuries before the birth of Caesar, while patri· Gallio
cian was still struggling with plebeiam while both were 332³&ss
still contending with rival peoples for supremacy, the battle of
Gauls first encountered their destined conquerere. For {zzfflia
a generation or more, the Celtic wanderers, whose kins· results.
men had already overflowed Gaul, crossed the Pyrenees,
and passed into Britain and into Ireland, had been pour·
ing, in a resistless stream, down the passes of the Alps„

They spread over Lombardy. They drove the Etruscam
from their strongholds in the north. 'I'hey crossed the
Po, and pushed further and further southward into
Etruria itself. At length they overthrew a Roman army 890 ac.
in the battle of the Qa, and marched unopposed
through the Colline Gate. 'I'he story of the sack and
burning of the city was noised throughout the civilized
world3 yet the disaster itself‚ though it was never for·
gotten, hardly affected the history of Rome. It probably
tended to rivet the bonds of union between her and the
other cities of Latium, and to strengthen her claim to
supremacy in Italy. From time to time during the next
century the Gauls returned to plunder: but their incur· .,
sions were repelled3 and the champion of Italian civili·
zation was Rome.

But the Roman dread of the Gauls long remained ;Ga11i0
and more than once Rome’s enemies enlisted their ser· mlffthe
vices against her. In the last Samnite war Samnites, enemies of
Etruscans, and Gauls made a desperate effort to crush RQ·
the rising power 3 and after this attempt had been frus- 295 ¹³⁰⁰·
trated, the Etruscans once again rose in revolt, and their
Gallio mercenarios destroyed a Roman army under the
walls of Arretium. It was not until the Senones had in 283 Β»,
their turn been defeated and expelled from Italy, and the
Boi, who hastened to avenge them, had been crushed
near the Lake of Vadimo, that the republic was finaUy 282 Β, 0,

released from the sear of Gallie invasion.
