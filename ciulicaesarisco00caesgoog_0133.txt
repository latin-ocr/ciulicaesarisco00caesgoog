5 Ex eo die dies continuos V Caesar pro castris suas 3
copias produxit et aciem instructam habuit, ut, si
vellet Ariovistus proelio contendere, ei potestas non
deesset. Ariovistus his omnibus diebus exercitum 4
castris continuit, equestri proelio cotidie contendit.

Stoffel. Stoffel also affirms that the only part of the Vosges
along which the flank march of Ariovistus would have been
practicable is the part between the two defiles which I have
mentioned3 but I am not sure that it would not have been
equally practicable further southward, between Cernay and
Roderen‚ where M. Jullian places it.. M. Jullian thinks that
Caesar originally encamped about a mile and a half south-west
of Cema-ff that Ariovistus encamped, in order to cut Caesar’s
communication, at Roderen, near the ‘benchmark’ fixcd by
the engineers who mazped the country 3 and that Caesar itched
his smaller camp on t e plateau between Michelbach an Guer-
wenheim. He obJ'ects that Stoffel laces the battle-field too far
north; but Caesar’s words (41,§ 5) s ow that he marched rapidly
from Vesontio and therefore probably pushed as far northward
as Stoffel thinks, and, moreover‚ it seems not unlikely that
Ariovistus, after he had failed to seize Vesontio (38, §Q 1-2‚ 7),

decide; but Stoffel could not excavate, as the site was covered
by vineyards (0. G„ pp. 636-52).

frumento . . . supportaretur. Cf. 37, ξ 5 ; 39, § 1; and 40,§ 11.

Notice that Caesar does not say that Ariovistus expected to
cut his communication with the convoys which he expected from
the Leuci and the Lingones (see 40, ξ 11).

ξ 3. pro castris . . . habuit. Caesar did this in order to restore
the nerve of his soldiers‚ who had perhaps not quite shaken off
the effect of their recent panic (see 39-40). We may infer from
B. 0., iii, 55, 1, 84, ξ 2 that artillery (see p. lxiv), of which
Ariovistus h none, were mounted‚ ready to protect them.
Ariovistus might attack is he liked : but if he attached, it would
be at his peril; if he declined the challenge, the legionarios
would be assured that the Germane were not invincible.

ut . . . non deesset. Though ut here expresses a purpose, and
the learner knows that in final sentences he must not write
ut non, but ne, he will not su pose that Caesar wrote bad Latin.
Ne here would be very wea 3 and ut . . . non deesset is justi-
fiable, because non deesset is virtually equivalent to adesset.
Meusel, indeed (L. 0., iii, 2410), and other editors take ut as
consecutive 3 but Schneider agrees with me.
