DE BELLO GALLICO
ooMnEN'rARmS PRIMUS

GALLIA est omnis divisa in partes tren, quarum 1 'rho three

1,§ 1. Gallia . . . ᾱίυὶεα. Notice the order of the words.
They must not be translated by ‘All Gaul ie divided ', which ie
not only hideoue, but wron . The meaning ie ‘ Gaul, taken ae
a whole, ie divided ¹. The &aral-Galliae and Galliarum—used
of the several divisione of Gaul, occure in Cicero (Fam, viii, 5,
§23 9, 2; &c.); and Caeearwiehed to make it clear that he
meant t e whole of Transalpine Gaul.

Celtae. This word, in ite wideet sense, denotee various
kindred o leo, who epoke languagee from which the modern
Celtic di eoa are descended; who ori inally inhabited Central
Euro ; and who migrated into Gau , Spain, Britain, Italy,
and 'a Minor. The Greek equivalente of Celtae and Galli
were need indifferently by Polybius. Caesar uses the word
Celtae in a narrow sense; for the Belgae aleo were a Celtic
people. Galli in Celtic meant ‘ warriore ’ or ‘ brave men ⁹. It
must be borne in mind that although all the ople who dwelt
between the Seine and the Garonne called emeelvee Celtae,
there were no Celtae there nome centuriee before Caesar'e time.
'l'he Celtae were a mixed opulation, descended partly from
pre-Celtic inhabitanta, partlg from Celtic con uerore.

ξ 2. linqua. See pp. xxiv-xxv, xxviii-xxx, vii. Celtic was
not generally spoken in Aquitania. The Aquitaniane epoke
Iberian, that is to say, S anieh dialecto, probably including
Baeqne, which in stin epofi

language of the Bryt one, or Britieh celte, from which Weleh
ie descended. Perhaps, however, in Caeear’e time some of the
Celtae epoke another Celtic dialect, akin to that which was
the anceetor of Gaeli03 for at a later period inscriptione were
erected in Gaul in a language which wau different from Gauliah3
and though it may have been a dead language (Latin inscrip-
tione belonging to our own time are to be seen in London), it
must have been once spoken in Gaul.
