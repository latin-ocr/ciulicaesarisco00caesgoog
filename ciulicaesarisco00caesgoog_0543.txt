in general the characteristics which, according to his
informante, belonged to the Suebi. It has been argued
that the nomadic tribes of whom he speaks (i, 36, ξ 7;
iv, 1, ξ 2; 4, §5 1-2) could not have practised the agri-
culture which is described in iv, 1, ἕξ 4—6; but does not
he himself expressly say (iv, 1, ξ 2) that they were pre·
vented from doing so? See W. Pleischmann‚ caesar . . .
und die Deutsche Landwirtschaft, 1911, and the reviews of
that work in Ber-liner philoloyische Wochenschvift, 1913,

col. 74—6, and Jahresberichte des philologi-when Vereins nu
Berlin, 1913, p. 60.

Cassan was evidently prepared on occasion ιο pay for
the corn which he requisitioned from the Gallie t1·ibes;
for in i, 16, §6 he writes yraviter eos accusat, quod, cwm
[frumentum] neque emi neque ex ayt-is sumi possit &c.;
and the negotiatores who had settled at Cenabum may have
contracted‚ as neyotiatores did under the Empire, to supply
the army. On the other hand, he of course took without
payment from rebellious tribes the corn which he required.
Probably he only paid when he could not afford to give
offence. cf. v, 41, ξ 5 and Tacitus, Αρνὶσοῖα, 19.

APPENDIX I
How ΤΟ VISIT CAESAR’S BATTLE·FIELDS, ETG.

Tun ‘ sheets ’ which 1 recommend belong, when no scale
is mentioned, to the Carta de Franco (72-5-010-5-5). The scale
wem is that of the Carta aa emafflnjor.

It would be well worth while to visit the Museo des
Antiquites Nationales (especially Salle XIII) at St. Germain·
en·Laye, which may be reached from Paris (St. Lazare) in
40 minutes. The various sites which I recommend are

1. Bibracte (Mont Beuvray).÷Paris (Gare de Lyon) to
Etang, changing at NeverS. From liltang drive to St. Leger-
sous·Beuvray. Sheet 41.

2. Armecy (i, 24, ξ 1).—Etang to moulon-sur-Arroux.
Or drive from St. Leger·sous-Beuvray. Sheet 41, or sheet
136 SE. (Πὲπ).

3. The probable site of the battle with Ariovistus (i, 48,
ξ l).—-Strasburg to Rappoltsweiler (43 minutes). The
alternative site mentioned in my note is near Thann,
39 minutes from Muhlhausen. Sheets 28 and 36.
