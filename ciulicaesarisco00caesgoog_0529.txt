south the plateau is practicallyimpregnab103 while the western
slopes, where, between the hamlets of Loulie and Leguillat,
there is a break in the escarpment, are steep enough ιο 'ustify
the statement of Hirtius that, even if no resistance hui been
offered, the ascent would have been difficult for armed men. On
this side, about 72 feet below the line which the walls of the
alleged fortress would have followed, there was a spring. 'rho
other to graphical features will be plain to any one who
. studies t e lan (facing p. 385). A charter, dated 944, proves

that the hillJ was then called Uxellodunum3 and there is no
evidence that an other place in the country of the Cadurci
was ever called y any such name. The Puy commanda the
northern entrance to the count of the Cadurci; and therefore
it is the very stronghold which acterius, fleeing from Caninius
(32, ξ 1), might have been expected ιο choose. Paths such as
those b which Hirtius says (35,§ 3) that Lucterius endeavoured
to sendy his pach-horses up the hill, are easily recognizable.
Traces of lines of investment have been discoveoed, and also
a gallery‚ driven thro h the western side of the hill to the
source of the spring. ut there is one serious objection. The
Puy d’Issolu is not almost entirel surrounded by a river, but
half surrounded by two 1·ivers; an therefore there is no isthmus
at all. It comes ιο this, then, that Luzech is the only place
where there is an isthmus ap roximately corresponding with
the deseri tion of Hirtius3 w ile the Puy d’Issolu is the only

lace whic , in other respects, corresponds with his description.

ut one can understand that Hirtius, if he never saw Uxello-
dunum, misunderstood the re ort which he followed3 whereas
it is hardly credible that he s ould have blundered wholesale‚
as he must have done if Uxellodunum was the same as Luzech.
Uxellodunum, then, must be identified with the Puy d'Issolu,
though doubts ma recur (0. G„ pp. 483-93).

V 'ones.- he Vangiones, one of the German tribes
which ought under Ariovistus (i, 51, ξ 2), occupied, in the time
of Ptolemy (moyn, ii, 9, ξ 9), the country round Borbetomagus
(W orms); but ιι is doubtful whether they were settled there
{ln the time of Caesar (C.G., pp. 493-4). See Nummus and

Veliocasses.—The Veliocasses, whose name survives, per-
haps, in ‘Vexin ', dwelt in the southern part of the department
of the Scine-Inferieure and the eastern part of the department
of the Eure (0. G„ p. 494).

Vellaunodunum was in the country of the Senones, on
a road leading from Agedincum (Sene) to Cenabum (Orleans).
Caesar marched from Agedincum ιο Vellaunodunum in two
days, and proceeded to besiege it on the day of his arrival.
In a couple of da s he surrounded it with a contravallation,
and on the third ay the garrison surrendered. After making
