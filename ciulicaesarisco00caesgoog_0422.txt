We may be sure that he took up his quartem among a friendly

people: the Lingones were the only eople‚ except the Remi,

who were too far from the theatre o war, upon whose friend-

ship he could depend (63, ξ 7) ; and their country was near that

of the Remi, who needed his protection against the Bellovaci

(90, 5), near that of the Aedui whose movements he had to

wate ‚ and conveniently situated for receiving the reinforce-

ments from Germany (Ο. G„ pp. 788—90). l
quod minus . . . utebantur. 'l'he German horsus, though

hardy, were small and light (iv, 2, ξ 2); and Caesar saw that

his new allies, unless they were provided with better animala,

would be at a disadvantage when they encountered the well·

mounted Galhc troopers.

scilicet . . . evocatis. The MS. reading is sed et (equitibus),
which, as Mommsen saw', was most probably a corruption of
scilicet. But Caesar would not have explained aliquamque by

§§ 2-3. Vercinyetore‘x . . . ammiserat. Vercingetorix had declared
that ‘ he would not tempt fortune by fighting a battle ³ (64, ξ 2),
and it has always been a puzzle why he now determined to
attack Cacsar. He made a mistake3 but that he yielded to
clamour 1 do not believe. It must be remembcred that what
he had said was that he would not fight a pushed battle (acie
dimicaturum); and he did not intend to. What he con-
templated was a flank attack upon Caesar's b ‘n
