ξ 7. subductis navibus. Ships were generally beached for the
winter, in order to prevent their timbers from rotting. Caesar-’s
were doubtless moved in the usual way,-by capstans over
greased logs, which the Romans called phalanyae. Can an
reader suggest what became of these ships—800 or more—whic
Caesar, as ar as we know, never used again ¹?

§8. cuius fines . . . LXXX. Caesar means, I su pose, that
the distance from the place where he landed to t e eastern
frontier of Cassivellaunus's kingdom was about 80 miles. Meusel
argues that Caesar could not have written these words: but in
fact he only brackets a mari . . . LXXX ; and his ar ment
leaves me unconvinced. He urges that the passage cou d onl
make sense if the Thames had flowed from north to sout
instead of from west to east, for it did not really separate the
territories of Cassivellaunus from those of the maritime tribes,
namely, the tribes of the south-east. Moreover, he argues,
alater statement (18, ξ 1)— Caesar. . ‚adflumen Tamesim in
fines Cassivellauni exercitum ducit—proves that the Thames
flowed tho-ouyh the territories of Cassivellaunus, and therefore
did not separate them from those of the maritime tribes.
Surely the passage means ⁸ Caesar led his arm to the Thames‚
into ‚the territory of Cassivellaunus ’.Γ-ἰ. e. to t e Thames, after
Essssssikssisffssdssff¹ 022..ss‘'ssss‘lwfisso‘sshfflffz‘ffssuffih{baffi-meg?
but any one who looks at the map and notices the sharp north·
eastward bend which the river makes from Weybridge to London
will see that he might very well have said that it se the
territory of Cassivellaunus from the maritime tri es. Klotz
(C.S., p. 49, n. 5) acutely remarks that if we follow Meusel
in bracketing this passage, we must suppose that Caesar
mentioned Cassivellaunus, the most important of the British
chieftains, without sa ing one word to indicate where his
klipgfflogffgfl'l althoug he did so in the cases of the minor
c 1e s ‚ ).

ξ 9. toti bello imperioque. Cf. ξ 8. This characteristically
Caesar-ian expression seems to imply that the imper-ium included
the eneral direction of the campaign and might be used in
conc uding alliances‚ making peace, ἃς.
