152 DE BELLO GALLICO

egredi ac se barbaris committere non auderet, V. die
ad Caesarem revertitur quaeque ibi perspexisset

renuntiat.
Certain 22 Dum in his locis Caesar navium parandarum causa
3³2¹]ss moratur, ex magna parte Morinorum ad eum legati 5
Morini venerunt, qui se de superioris temporis consilio
ἷξὲῗζ excusarent, quod homines barbari et nostrae consuetu-
submit. dinis imperiti bellum populo Romano fecissent, seque

2 ea quae imperasset facturos pollicerentur. Hoc sibi
Caesar satis oportune accidisse arbitratus, quod neque 10
post tergum hostem relinquere volebat neque belli
gerendi propter anni tempus facultatem habebat neque
has tantularum rerum occupationes Britanniae ante-
ponendas iudicabat, magnum iis numerum obsidum
'rho trans- 3 imperat. Quibus adductis eos in fidem recipit. N avi· 15

not neglect precautions which any com etent officer would
have taken, and that 116 did not overloo what no observant
man could have failed to perceive. He spent three entire days
in British waters ; and his time must have been fully occu ied.
of course he observed the country as far inland as he coul see.
But he did more. We may be sure that he noted that the
beach was of shingle3 that he took soundings all alon the
coast between Walmer and Deal (see the first note on 23, 6) as
close inshore as he could venture to 0; and that he watched
the phenomena which twice daily 0 truded themselves upon
his attention,-— the rise and fall of the tide and the movement
up and down the Channel of the tidal stream (A. Β., pp. 309-12).

auderet. See the note on i, 36, § 4. Kraner remarks that
the words contain an implied censure on Volusenus. This ab·
surd comment is stultified by quantum. . . potuit, which shows
tlliatggolusenus did all that it was possible for him to do. See
a so ‚ 5.

22, ξ 1. ex . . . Morinorum. The Morini do not act here as
a united people, but individual payi act on their own account.
Evidently the political or ization of the tribe was very loose,
and the authority of the &ei-nmen very weak.

60 11111611 because they had disobeyed Caesar as because they
were afraid of him ; and quod . . ,fecissent defines their apology.
One might translate ex mayna . . . fecissent by ‘ envoys came . . .
to apologiae for their recent conduct in attacking ', &a

barbam· here means ‘ uncivilized ⁹.

ξ 3. contractisque. Meusel (J. Β., 1910, p. 65) deletes these
words, on the ground that ‘contractis can here mean nothing
