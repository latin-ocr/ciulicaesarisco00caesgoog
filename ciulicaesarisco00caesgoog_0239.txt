them. But the dust would have been invisible from the camp
unless the cornfield was close ιο the edge of the high ground ; and
who will believe that the only field which the Romans had lest
unreaped was the one nearest them Ῥ in I leave unnoticed
various reasons which rove that Caesar ‘d not land anywhere
west of the South Fore d.

East Kent alone remains. The montes off which Caesar
anchored were the lofty cliffs between Dover and the Foreland
—the eliffs of which Cicero was thinking when he said (Ata, iv,
16, § 7) that ‘ the approaches to the island are ramparted with
astonishing masses of cliff ' (aditus insulae esse muratos mirificis
molihus)—and a run of 7 miles brought him to the coast
between Walmer Castle and Deal Castle. Only one serious
objection has been made. Caesar says that he ‘remained till
the ninth hour, waiting at anchor for the other ships to join
him ². 'Phe ninth hour ended at 3.30 p.m., and as high water
at Dover on that day was at 621 a.m., the stream would
nor-»nally have been runuin westward at 3.30 .m. and would
not have turned eastward ’ l 524 p.m. This ο jection can be
easily disposed of. Supposing that Caesar's rough estimate of
the time was correct, it is not certain that he weighed anchor
immediately after the ninth hour3 when the overdue ships
arrived their skippers had, 1 suppose, to receive instructions, as
the generals and military tribunes had done already3 and to
get the ships into order, to give the signal for starting, and
to weigh anchor must have taken some time. Moreover, the
time at which the stream turns depends greatly upon the wind 3
the wind, blowing in the same direction as the stream, would
have accelerated the turm and it has been proved by a series of
observatione that after high water at 6.21 a.m. the stream may
have turned eastward before 3.54 p.m.

If the reader is interested in the subject, this note (which is
necessarily a mere makeshift) will probably have suggested
questions which he would like to have answered. If so, let
him read the article to which I have referred at the beginning;
and any doubt that he may feel will be cleared up.
