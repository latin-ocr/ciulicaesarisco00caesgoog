282 DE BELLO GALLICO ι

Germanos equites circiter CCCC submittit, quos ab

2 initio secum habere instituerat. Eorum impetum Galli
sustinere non potuerunt atque in fugam coniecti multis
amissis se ad agmen receperunt. Quibus profligatis,
rursus oppidani perterriti comprehensos eos quorum 5
opera plebem concitatam existimabant ad Caesarem

3 perduxerunt seseque ei dediderunt. Quibus rebus
confectis Caesar ad oppidum Avaricum, quod erat
maximum munitissimumque in finibus Biturigum
atque agri fertilissima regione, profectus est, quod eo Ιῡ
oppido recepto civitatem Biturigum se in potestatem
redacturum confidebat.

ab initio. Caesar had no German cavalry in his first campaign ς,
but he had perha s begun to raise them before the winter os
54 Β. c. (v, 26, ξ ), having learned in his campaign against
Ariovistus (i, 48, §§ 5-7) how good they were. Ab initio, there·
fore, either means ‘from the outset' of the seventh campaign,
or from the time when Caesar first emplo ed German cavalry.

14, ξ 5. Boia means the country of t e Boi. A Boia was,
however, rightly bracketed by Scaliger. Why should Vercin-
getorix have decided to burn the towns all round Boia, and yet
to spare Boia itself, from which the Romans expected supplies
(17, 2) *Ρ Besides, if the country on all sides of Boia was evas·
tate ‚ the Aedui, in whose country Boia was situated (i. 28, 5),
must have burned their own towns: but it is certain that t ey
did not, for they had not yet joined Vercingetorix. Madvig
ingeniously conjectured that Caesar had written ab m'a (quoque
versus) -— ⁸ all round the road ’-— and that it was carelessly altered

by a copyist into aboia3 but Caesar never, as far as we knoW,
wrote ab before v (C. G„ pp. 740-2).
