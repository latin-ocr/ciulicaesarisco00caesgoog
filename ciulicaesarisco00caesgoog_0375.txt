COMMENTARIUS VII 293

grandibus in fronte saxis efferciuntur. His conlocatis 8
et coagmentatis alius insuper ordo additur, ut idem
illud intervallum servetur neque inter se contingant
trabes, sed paribus intermissis spatiis singulae singulis

5 saxis interiectis arte contineantur. Sic deinceps omne 4
opus contexitur, dum iusta muri altitudo expleatur.
Hoc cum in speciem varietatemque opus deforme non 5
est alternis trabibus ac saxis, quae rectis lineis suos
ordines servant, tum ad utilitatem et defensionem

10 urbium summam habet oportunitatem, quod et ab
incendio lapis et ab ariete materia defendit, quae
perpetuis trabibus pedum quadragenum plerumque
introrsus revincta neque perrumpi neque distrahi
potest. ⁴

ξ 3. Hie conlocatis . . . arte contineantur. Schneider believes
that trabes here denotes, not any two balks, but the seveial
vertical [2] lines of balks‚ which were prevented from touching
each other by intervening com-ses of rubble. Long, on the
other hand, pointing out in his edition (p. 347) that ut idem
illud intervallum servetur ‘expresses the intervals between the
balks iu the second tier ³, argues that neque inter sc continqant
tmbes ‘is unneeessary unless 1t means something else'. Accord-
ingly he supposes that the balks in the second tier were laid on
the stenes of the first. The arrangement may or may not have
been what he describes3 but he fails to see that if his interpre-
tation of the Latin is right, either the trabes which ars the
subject of contineantur denote something different from the
trabes which are the subject of continyant, the latter denoting
the balks both of the first and the second row, the former those
of the second only 3 or, if in both cases trabes denotes the balks
both of the first and the second row, poribus spatiis does not
mean intervals similar to those in the first row, but intervals
similar to one another. Such an interpretation seems to me
wrong.

Remains of Gallio walls have been discovered at Mursceint in
the department of the Lot, and elsewhere. At Mursceint there
are three or four stenes between the balks of each layer, and
three layers of stenes between every two layers of mingled
stenes and balks. But the walls which have been discovered
are not all alikez and as Caesar does not mention any layer
os stenes, p4erhaps the wall of Avaricum had no such layer

internam-is. The MS. reading is inter-»nissam but Meusel
(J. B„ 1894, pp. 321-2) shows that this could only mean (balks)
⁶ free from ' (equal intervals) !
