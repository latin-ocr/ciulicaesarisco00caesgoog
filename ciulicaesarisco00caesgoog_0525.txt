PICTONES-—SOTIATES 429

‘ the first people outside the Province, beyond the Rhene ’; and
it is evident from 12-13 that when he entered their country he
was on the eastern bank of the Saone. The greater part of
their territory, however, was on the western bank; for two of
their towns, Rodumna. (Roanne) and Forum S usiavorum
(Feurs), which Ptolemy mentions (Geoyr.‚ ii, 8, ξ 1 ), were on
that side, and indeed Rodumna was west of the Loire. Their
chief town was Lugdunum (Lyons); and the western rt of
their country seems to have comprised that part of the ‘ocese
of Lyons which was on the ri ht bank of the Rhene and of the
Saone. It is impossible to de ne the tract which the possessed
between the Rhene and the Saone; but it was pro ably very
small, for Trevoux, which is 25 miles south of Macen, bein
situated between two places called Amberieux, may be suppose
to have belonged to the Ambarri (Ο. G„ pp. 470-1).

Sens3 and the dioceses of Auxerre (Autessiodurum) and Troyes

he looks at the mal), they were dependants or a subdivision of
the Senones (C. G.. pp. 471-3).

&quanm—the Seme.

aequm—The Sequani were separated from the Helvetii by
the Jura (i, 2, ξ 3), from the Leuci by the Vosges, from the
Aedui, according to Strabo (iv, 3, §2) and Ptolemy (Geoyffi ii, 8,
ξ 12), b the Saone, and from the Allobroges, in part (see Β. G„
1, 11, ἔ 5), by the Rhene. [Phe Aedui, however, probably
possessed those parts of the dioceses of Chalon (Cavillonum)
and Macon (Matisco) (vii, 90, ᾗ 7) which extend eastward of
the Saone3 and the Sequani were cut off from the lower
reaches of that river by the Ambarri and the Segusiavi.
Roughly s eaking‚ their territory corresponded with the
diocese of esancon (Vesontio) and comprised Franche-Comte
and the greater art of Alsace (Ο. G„ pp. 473-4).

Sibusate8.-— he Sibusates probably dwelt in the neighbour-
hood of Sobusoe, between Dax and Bayonne; but there is no
evidence exce t the resemblance between the names.

Sotiate8.-— e Sotiates possessed the country round Sos in
the de artment of the Lot-et-Garonne. 'I'he evidence for identi-
fying os with the stronghold of the Sotiates which Crassus
sss a 212..er Μ’ <1¹² sursise 0522}
called Scittium, which is identifiedp by the statement of its
distances from Elusa (Eauze) and Vasata (Bazas) with Sos:
and the form Sc1·t[t]ium may have been due to a misreading of
Sotium, the scribe mistaking an ill-formed o for ci. Crassus,
having passed through the country of the Nitiobroges (see the
note on iii, 20, ξ 2), entered Aquitania, and the Sotiates were ·
the people whom he first encountered (20, ξ 3), which condition
is satisfied by the position of Sos. Moreover, recent excavations
at Sos prove that it was a Gallie stronghold (R.E.A.‚ 1913, p. 81).
