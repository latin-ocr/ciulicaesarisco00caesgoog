ξ 10. Huc onmes . . . parent. In ξ 5 Caesar has said that the
Druids ‘ are judges in nemius all disputes ’ (fe re de omnibus con·
tmveaese‘is . . . constituunt). Probably the suitors who appealed
to them were equites (ξ 3), who alone could afford the expense of
the joui-ney, and who, having, as Caesar says (§ 3), unlimited
rights over their dependants, may have settled their petty dis-
putes without having recourse to Druids. The Druids had not
a mono oly of jurisdiction. The Aeduan Vergobret (i, 16, ξ 5
and p. liv) had ‘the power of life and death over his country-
men ⁹, just as fathers had over their wives and children (vi, 19,
ξ 3); and the chief magistrate of every tribe adjudicated on
offences‘ against the state (i, 45 v, 56, ξ 3; vii, 4, ξ 1), though
the punishment which he inflicted may have ,been sanctioned
and superintended by DruidS.

§ 11. Disciplina . . . existimatur. This passage has occasioned
much discussion, some scholars accepting Caesar’s statement as
literally true, while others maintain that he was misinformed.
It has been suggested that the Belgae who invaded Britain
(v, 12, ξ 2) may have found Druidism flourishing there, and
made it known in Gaul, whence they had come: but they were
not the first Celtic invaders3 and if Druidism was really of
British origin, it had probably been imported into Gaul before.
On the other hand, there is no evidence that the Gauls who
invaded Ital and defeated the Romans in 390 B.c. were accom-
panied by ruids; and if they were not, it is reasonable to

believing it. M.Camille J ullian ( H. G„ ii, 88—9), remarking that
the Germans‚ who were akin to the Celts and had always been
closely connected with them, had no priests in Caesar’s time
(B. G„ vi, 21, ξ 1), but had a century later (Tacitus, Germania,
10), argues that among the Celts also the riestly office had
once been exercised by the tribal king-s, ut had naturally
become specialized3 in other words, he holds that Druidism
was a Celtic institution, which arose comparatively'lateff-

Tacitus, especially in the western and less civilized districts 3
and it may be doubted whether at the time of its birth remote
British tribes were politically or socially more advanced than
