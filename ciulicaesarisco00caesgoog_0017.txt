THE TEXT OF THE COMMENTARIES

Evam( one who can read the Commentarios with interest
will want to know how far the manuscripts in which
they have been handed down to us correspond with what
Caesar wrote; for if he will think, he will see that none
of them correspond with it exactly‚ and that although
scholars have been trying ever since 1469, when the first
printed edition was published‚ to remove the errors,
many must still and always will remain. 'rho oldest of
the extant manuscripts was written fully 900 years after
the book was first put into circulation. Now, however
careful a scribe may be, he can hardly avoid making
some mistakes in copying out a written book ; the scribe
who copies his copy will make more ; and so on. Even
contemporary copies of Gaesar's original manuscript
doubtless contained mistakes. Cicero¹ complains that
books sold by the booksellers of Rome had been care·
lessly copied ; and, notwithstanding all the care of proof-
readers, few modern books are entirely free from printers’
errors. Resides, a manuscript might pass into the hands
of a reader who would make notes on the margin ; and if
another copy were to be made from the one which con-
tained these notes, the copyist might be misled into
incorporating them in the text. 'I‘hus two kinds of mis-
takes would gradually find their way in. An example
of the latter kind—nocte intermissa—will be found in
i. 27, ξ 4. An example of the other shows how even
a very careful copyist might go astray. In viii, 32, ξ 2
the famous stronghold, Uerodunum, is mentioned for the
first time. Uxellodunum was only written by the copyist
in two of the good manuscripts: the rest have auxilio
dunum, which, as every one will see, is nonsense. Can
you imagine how this curious blunder was made? In
this way. In some manuscript a reader wrote either
in the margin or above uxellodunum (not Uxellodunum,
for even proper names were written with small initial
letters) the words a. uxillodunum, and by α., which was an
