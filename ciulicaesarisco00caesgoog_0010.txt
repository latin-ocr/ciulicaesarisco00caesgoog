iv PREFACE

should be impracticable‚ to read them aloud them-
selves. I feel less diffidence in making this suggestion
because it has been made already by well-known
critics as well as by the Curricula Committee of the
Classical Association‚ and because the books which
I have named have been in part translated into
German for the use of schools. If, before a boy
begins to grapple with Caesar's Latin, he has got
a general notion of the whole story, he will work with
far more heart.

The principle to which Ι have adhered in writing
my notes has been to avoid giving any information
which the learner can easily acquire for himself
through the medium of grammar, dictionary‚ or such
other books as he may fairly be supposed to have.
My aim has been not to save him the labour—if
I had done so he would only have been bored—but to
let him feel the pleasure of thinking; and I have
therefore tried, as far as was possible with due regard
to space, to appeal to his reason,—not only to state
resultS, but to enable him to follow the steps by
which they were attained. Merely inform a pupil that
Alesia was situated on Mont Auxois‚ and you will
profit him little, for cut-and-dried information is
indigestible; but make him understand that it was
there and that to suppose that it was anywhere else
involves absurdities, and you will set his intellect to
work. I desire indeed to appeal not only to the learner's
reason but also to his scepticism and his latent critical
acumen. I should be glad to hear that he had tried
to pick holes in my arguments3 for I do not wish
him to accept them until he is convinced that they
are sound. For the benefit of any one who may be
disposed to test them, Ι have given at the end of
various notes references to my larger books; and
I hope that some readers may feel moved to gain such
a mastery of the subject as is unattainable with a
succinet commentary.
