388 DE BELLO GALLICO

ne civibus quidem suis se committebat, tamen celeriter
5 omnium cura quaesitus in castra perducitur. Cogitur
in eius supplicium Caesar contra suam naturam
concursu maximo militum, qui ei omnia pericula et
detrimenta belli a Gutuatro (concitati) accepta 5
referebant, adeo ut verberibus exanimatum corpus

securi feriretur.

Drappete et Lucterio gesta essent quoque in consilio

temnebat, tamen pertinaciam magna poena esse adfi-
ciendam iudicabat‚ ne universa Gallia non vires sibi

defuisse ad resistendum Romanis sed constantiam
putaret, neve hoc exemplo ceterae civitates locorum

of the two leaders who perpetrated that massaere. Whether
certain priests who are mentioned in inscriptions as qutuatn'
were3 Dru2ids or not, is uncertain (0. G„ pp. 831-2; Δ. B„
.29 , n. ).
P ξ 5. α Gutuatro (concitati). 'I'he MSS„ except S, which
omits both words, have a Gutruato simply, which is nonsense
and was deleted by Oudendorp. But, as Klotz remarks (C. S„
p. 177, n. 2), it seems improbable that these words were inter·
olated, and I therefore adopt his emendation, though it must
Ee admitted that a Gutuatro, following ei. is awkward.

was to expire on March 1, 705 (49 13.c.) ; therefore unam aesta·
tem means the summer of 50 Β. ο. Some scholare have argued
that it means the summer of 51 Β. 0.‚—that is to say, the sum-
mer in which the siege of Uxellodunum was ing on ; but this
is impossible. When Caesar started for Uxe lodunum the sum·
mer of 51 was already far advanced; for we are told (46, ξ 1
that immediately after the capture of the fort only the sag-en
of the summer (extremum tem s aestivorum) remained. Unam
aestatem cannot mean a sma l part of summer; and if Hirtius
had been thinking of the summer of 51 Β. 0., he would have
written exiyuampartem aestatis. cf. iv, 20, 1 (0. G„ p . 832—4).

Caesar’s command was to terminate on the last da of Decem·
ber, 50 1³.c. He admits of course that the riod or which he
was originally appointed did not end until arch 1, 54 (this is
proved by Cicero, De prov. cona, 15, ξ 37), that the extension
(see the second note on iii, 9, ξ 2) was to last for another riod
of five years; and that Cicero (Ata, vii, 7, § 6) was justi ed in
stating that the whole period amounted to ten years: but he
