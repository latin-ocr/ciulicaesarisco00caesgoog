INTRODUCTION li

for fear the letter might be intercepted and read. At
an earlier time there were natives, at least in the Pro·
vince, who acquired a smattering of Greek. Rich en·
thusiasts resorted to Massilia as a school of learning,
and became so enamoured of Greek culture that they
wrote contracte in the language of their teachers. Indeed
in all that belonged to outward prosperity the peoples of
Gaul had made great strides since their kinsmen first
came in contact with Rome ; and the enormous fortunes
which Caesar and his staff amassed are evidence of their
wealth.

The coins which have just been mentioned require Goins.
special notice; for none of the antiquities of the Later
Iron Age have thrown more light upon the culture of
the Gauls. 'I'he oldest were copied in the earlier half of
the third century before Christ from gold coins of Philip
of Macedon, which had been introduced through Massilia.
For some time they bore no inscription, except the name
of Philip, more or less deformed; but about the middle
of the following century—more than a hundred years
before the same change was made in our island—they
began to be stamped with the names of the rulers by
whom they were issued, among whom are to be recog·

notably the great Vercingetorix, whose coins are worth
about fifty times their weight in gold. Greek characters
are sometimes quaintly jumbled with Latin, which
gradually became familiar after the Romans had estab-
lished their footing in the land. Many Roman coins,
indeed, must have been circulated in Gaul after the
colonization of Narb03 and Roman influence is apparent
on many Gallic coins, for example in a figure of Pegasus,
which appears on one that bears the name of Tasgetius,
Kiug of the Carnutes. For many years gold coins were
the only medium of exchange3 but, as commercial needs
increased, silver and bronze passed gradually into use,
the coins of the latter metal being imitated from those
of Massilia, and, in the case of certain Belgic specimenS,
even from those of Campania. The coins, indeed, illus·
