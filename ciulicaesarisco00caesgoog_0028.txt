xxii THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL

by hunters belonging to what is generally called the
Neanderthal race, after a skull which was found about
fifty years ago in the valley of the Neander in Rhenish
⁰ Prussia. As far as we can tell from the bones that have
been discovered, they were short, sturdy men, with very
low receding foreheads, huge projecting brow ridges, and
certain ape-like featureS‚—for instance, extremely defective
chius. These people, although they manufactured flint
tools with considerable skill, were certainly much inferior
in mental power to others of a different type who were
their contemporaries; and towards the end of the Palaeo-
lithic Age there dwelt in South-Western Gaul a people
wh0, as we may infer not only from their beautifully
formed heads, but from the wonderful works of art which
I have mentioned in the Introduction, were as intelligent
as modern Europeans. Skulls of this type were dis·
covered at Laugerie·Basse and Chancelade in the valley of
the Lozere; and nearly related to the race which they
represent were people remarkable for great stature, some
of whose skeletons have been unearthed from caves near
Mentone, and who are generally called after a specimen
that was found beneath the rock-shelter of Cro-Magnon
in Perigord.

Thus even in the Old Stone Age the inhabitants of
Gaul belonged to several different types. Some ethnolo-
gists believe that the Neanderthal race became extinct3
but descendants of the other groups were living in
Caesar’s time ; and their descendants are living now.

So much for the Palaeolithic Age. of the Neolithic
Age, which followed it, we of course know much more.
The skeletons that have been found belong for the most
part to two groups. ‘Both were short or of middle height,
and both, as we may infer from the complexion of their
modern descendants, were dark; but the shorter, who
are called after Grenelle‚ near Paris, where six typical
specimens were discovered, were sturdily built and had
short round heads; while the others, the most famous
representatives of whom belonged to the caverns of
l’Homme Mort and Baumes-Chaudes in the department
of the Lozere, were generally slender and had well-formed
