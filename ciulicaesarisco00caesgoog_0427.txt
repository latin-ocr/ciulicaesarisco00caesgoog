think, he will see that Vercin etorix had already prepared
Alesia for defence, so that he mig t have a stronghold to retreat
to in case of need. Perhaps he ho ed to be as successful there
as he had been at Gergovia. Any ow, beaten as he was and
hotly pursued by Caesar, he had no choice but to establish
himself in a strong position, lest he should be compelled to
fight another and yet more disastrous battle and lest his
disheartened troops should disperse (Ο. G„ p. Sol).

altero die . . . secie. This sentence completes the evidence
for determining the site of the battle which is described in
ch. 67. It is as follows 2-While Caesar was marching ⁴ throu h
the furthest rt of the country of the Lingones towards t e -
country of t e Sequani ’‚ Vercingetorix formed three camps
about 10 Roman miles from Gaesar’s army (66, §§ 2-3). During
the combat the Gallie infantry were drawn up m front of these
three campe (66, § 6), behind a stream (67, ξ 5), in order to
produce a moral effect. On the right of the Roman arm
there was a hill, down which Caesar’s German cavalry charge .
This charge decided the battle; and the Gallie cavalry, afraid
of being surrounded‚ fied to the stream (67, δ 5). Vercingetorix
immediately ren-eated to Alesia (68, § ): Caesar pursued the
beaten army until n' htfall and reached the outskirts of Alesia
on the next day (683 2-3). The words cum Caesar in Sequanos
per extremos Lingonum fines iter faceret (66, ξ 2) show that
when Vercingetonx made his three campe Caesar was still in
the country of the Lin ones, and, as 1 have shown elsewhere
(0. G„ pp. 792-4), that e was marching through that part of
the country of the Lingones which was furthest (mmmm) from
his starting·point in the direction in which he was going. As
to his startin -point, we only know that it was somewhere in
the country o} the Lingones (see the first note on 65, ξ 5),-

robably in the north or north-west. The direction in which

It seems clear, therefore, that we must look for the battle-field
in the south-eastern part of the country of the Lingones,-that
is, in the ne‘ hbourhood of Dijon. M. Jullian agrees with me;
and a site w ich he found seems to me the most satisfactory
that has been proposed. You can walk to it from Dijon in
about an hour and a quarter. M. J ullian suggests that Caesar
encamped the night before the battle on a hill north of
Til-chatel and overlooking the river Tille, and that he
