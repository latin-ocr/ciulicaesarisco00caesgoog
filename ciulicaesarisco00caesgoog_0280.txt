198 DE BELLO GALLICO

Q. Titurium Sabinum et L. Aurunculeium Cottam
6 legatos praeesse iussit. Ad hunc modum distributis
legionibus facillime inopiae (rei) frumentariae sese
7 mederi posse existimavit. Atque harum tamen om-
nium legionum hiberna, praeter eam quam L Roscio 5
in pacatissimam et quietissimam partem ducendam
8 dederat, milibus passuum C continebantur. Ipse in-
terea, quoad legiones conlocatas mu‘nitaque hiberna
cognovisset, in Gallia morari constituit.

But w at about the cohortes V‘? They were certainly veterans;
for otherwise Caesar, after saying that the 1 'on had been
recently raised, would not have omitted to ad that the five
cohorte were recruits. But if they were veterane, they must
have belonged to one or more of the other legions. Now,
althou h we have just seen that Caesar had nine legions in this
year, tzere is reason to believe that they were only equivalent
to eight and a half, for Sabinus's newly raised legion and his
five cohorts were annihilated in the autumn (v, 37) τ three new
legions were raised in the following year (vi, 1, 4 ς and at the
end of that year Caesar had ten. General A. von ὅ er suggested
that the five cohorte of Sabinus's bri e belonged to one of the
old 1 ione, and that the men who elonged to the remaining
five o the same legion were drafted into those legions which
had lost most by death or disease. 1f von Goler is wrong,
Sabinus's five cohorte must have been detachments from other
legions: in other words, Caesar, althou h he had nominally ten
legions in 53 Β. c„ only had the equiva ent of nine and a half,
five of the ten having each only 9 cohorte. It seems to me
