cuniculo hostes succenderant, eodemque tempore toto 10
muro clamore sublato duabus portis ab utroque latere

teriam de muro in aggerem ,eminus iaciebant, picem
reliquasque res quibus ignis excitari potest fundebant,

Caesaris duae semper legiones pro castris excubabant
pluresque partitis temporibus erant in opere, celeriter
factum est ut alii eruptionibus resisterent, alii turres
reducerent aggeremque interscinderent, omnis vero 20

24‚§ 1. latum pedes CCCXXXdenotes the extension of the ayyer
parallel with the wall of Avaricum. 'l'he great height-80 feet
—is accounted for by a depression of the ground in ftont of the
wall : the hinder part of the ‹1990›- was of course much lower
(G. G„ pp. 748-9). The ayyer was necessarily very broad,
because it not only carried two towers, on the ri ht and on the
left, but also served as a platform, over which t e legionaries
advanced to storm the town (27, §§ 2-3). The question arises
whether the platform filled the entire space between the
viaducts along which the towers moved, or only the sront part
of that space. Gener-al de Reffye‚ whose explanation was
accepted by Napoleon 111, adopted the latter view, and suggested
that the troops ascended the platform from the rear by steps.
This seems to me quite probable3 for we may be sure that
labour was saved as much as possible ς and the platform perhaps
occu ied only so much space as was requisite to afford room sor
the eading com anies of the columns of assault. An reader
who finds himsel in Paris may go and see a model of t e ayyer
at Avaricum by General de Reffye in Salle xm of the Museo de
St. Germain (C. G„ pp. 603-4).

§3. tum-tum. Perhaps the reader has already seen whose
towers are meant. 1f not, let him think.
