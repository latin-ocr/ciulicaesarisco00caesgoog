is hideous. Perhaps this will do :—‘ (while the Gauls, from the

roximity of the provinces and familiarity with sea-borne pro-
Enete, are abundantly supplied) with luxuries and articles of
daily consumption.'

25-8 are condemned as an interpolation hy Meusel (J. B„
1910, pp. 26-9) and Klotz (C.S., pp. 50-4). Meusel's chief
reasons are that even if Germany and the adjacent eastern
lands were far more extensively wooded in Caesar's time than
now, he would not have stated the breadth of the Hercynian
forest (25, ξ 1) as a fact, but would haye written patere dicitur,

on the western bank of the Rh1ne; that the Nemetes lived
north, not, as one would infer from ξ 2, south of the Ram-ach
that itis inconceivable that Caesar would have been so credulous
as to state as facts the absurdities which abound in ch. 27 ; and
finally that the chapters contain many expressions which
Caesar would not have used :——for instance, he would not have
written demonstrata est (25, ξ 1) in reference to a matter which
he had only just mentioned (24, 2), but commemorata esu he
would not have used summo (2 ’,ξ 22 as· a noun, διο. It is

ments : certainly the Helvetii were west of the Rhine, but oritur
ab Helvetiorum . . „finibus means ‘Starting ftom the [eastern]
frontiers of the Helvetii ', ecc. (cf. i, 1, ξ 6,-Βά9αε ab extoemc's
Galliae finibus oriuntur). Stin, every critical reader must have
suspected the authenticity of the chapters.

25, ξ 1. Huius shows, as Meusel remarks, that the interpolated

chapters were originally written as a marginal note to 24,
ξ 2 ε when the note was incorporated in the text, the scribe felt
1t necessary to add quae supra demonstmta est.

ξ 2. ‹tl‘ecta . . . reqione obviously means ⁴ along the line of the
Danube '; but Meusel observes that, according to vii, 46, ξ 1
and other passages, the words ought to mean ‘ at right angles
to the Danube ’. Ι do not think that this objection is valid.
Ε reqione oppidi means ‘opposite the town’3 but regio, in the
sense in which it is used here, simply means ‘line' or ‘direction‘.
cf. vii, 46. ξ 1, where recta reqione means ‘in a straight line ’.
