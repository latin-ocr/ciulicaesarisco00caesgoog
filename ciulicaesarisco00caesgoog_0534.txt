warlike Bal uchis, which several times outnumbered his
own, in the battle of Miani. Still, 7 to 2 is an excessive
discrepancy (though if, as Ι believe [oaesar’s Conquoet os
Gaul, pp. 239, 630]‚ many of the Gauls never came into
aetion, it would have been considerably reduced) ; and one
is the more inclined to be sceptical when one remembers
that, according to Caesar’s own estimate (i, 31, ξξ 5, 10),
the army of Ariovistus, which, after a hard struggle, he
defeated with six legions, amounted to not more than
36‚000, or perhaps about 4o‚000 men (see Caesar-’s conqvest
of Gaul, pp. 654-5 and 655, note 5). Again, Caesar tells
us (i, 29, ξ 3) that the host, including women and children,
which he sent back to Helvetia numbered 110‚000 ; and,
as I have shown in Gaesasts Conquest of Gaul (pp. 240-1),
if we accept both this estimato and his abstract of the
Helvetian schedule‚ we must infer that about 126‚000
perished in the battle (1), or else that very large numbers
had dispersed on the march. The former supposition at
all events is utterly incredible.

Let us now consider the question with reference to the
length of the Helvetian column. The Helvetii had no
artillery or ammunition wagonS, which occupy so much
space in modern marches, but they were encumbered
by numerous supply wagons. Ι have quoted (i, 29, ξ 8)
Napoleon’s estimate‚—8,500. Flour sufficient to seed, say,
307,000 persons (see the note on i, 29, ξ 8, and ansar's
Conquest of Gaul, p. 241, note 3) is said to have been
taken. A fair allowance for each man in a modern army
is 13: lb. of bread or 1 lb. of biscuit per day (The Solate-’s
Pocket·Book, pp. 96-7). The Helvetii, who plundered
largely, doubtless ate meat as well ; and the women and
children would have needed less food than the men: so
let us suppose that the average daily allowance of bread
or its equivalent was 1 15. per head. A sack of fiour
(280 15.) yields at least 92 4-15. loaves (Ency. Brit„ iv,
1910, p. 469): therefore 68 15. of flour per head, or
20,876,0001b. for the whole host, would have suffioed.¹
Over very bad roads two horses will draw a load (exclusive
of the wagon) of 1,9ΟΟ 15. (The Soldier's Poeta-Book, p. 70),
and 4 bullocks will draw 2,ΟΟΟ 15. (ih). Caesar (i, 8, ξ 1)
says that the Helvetii used iumenta, by which he may
have meant not only horses but also mules and oxen.
10,987 two-horse wagons or 10,438 bullock·carts could

¹ Bread, in the absence of field ovens, is evidently out of the
question: perhaps the emigrante made their flour into porridge.
We are not told that the Rauraci, Tulingi, Latobrigi, and Boi took
atliy flour with them ; but 1 assume that they did not depend upon
p under.
