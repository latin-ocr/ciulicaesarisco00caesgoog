(PORTUS) ITIUS-LEMONUM 421

in charge of the flotilla at Boulogne found it impooeible, in the
niost favourable circumstances, to get more than 100 vessels
out of the harbour in one tide; and therefore it was necessary
for each successive relay of shi s to anchor outside in the
roadstead until the whole flotilla ad cleared the harbour. But

arose, to return for sheltei· into the barboui·; for south-westerly
winds, which were favourable for the voyage, nerally made
the roadstead unsafe. Now Caesar says (8, §35 that he ‘set
sail towards sunset’ (ad soli-s occasum naves solvit); and these
words appear to mean that his fleet beqan to move out of the
harbour towards sunset. If so, assuming that Portus Itius was
Boulogne, the whole business of clearin the hai-bour must have
been completed within an hour and a alf, or the fleet would
have been sti-un out over a space of at least 7 nautical miles.
Perhaps, if tlie arbour was sufficientl large and deep, such
a feat would have been just practicab eg but, as there were
inore than 800 ships, the crews could not have accomplished it
unless they were very smart and perfectly organized. It is,
indeed, possible to interpret Caesar's words in the sense that
the leading ships had begun to move out some hours before
sunset and anchored in the roadstead until the whole fleet had
cleared the harbour3 but Caesar, like Napoleon, may perhaps
have feared that freshenin winds would make the anchor e
unsafe. On the other han , from Wissant, or rather from t e
beach between Cape Gris-Noz and Cape Blanc-Nez‚ the shallow
flat-bottonied vessels, which had been specially constructed ‘ to
enable them to be . . . hauled up on shore ’ (1, ξ 2), could have
started simultaneously 3 and Caesar may pei-ha s have thought
tvgat this advantage would outweigh all the isadvantages of

issant.

ppLatobgigi.—The Latobrigi, the Rauraci, and the Tulingi
were near neighbours of the Helvetii (i, 5, ξ 4). According
ιο Ptolemy (ωορκ, ii, 9, ξ 9), the chief towns of the Rauraci
were Augusta (Augst), about 7 miles east b south of Basle,
and Argentovaria, which was probably near eidolsheim, close
ιο the common frontier of U er and Lower Alsace: but this
evidence is not decisive 3 for, ῗίιίςο the Ubii and othei· Rhenish
tribes, the Rauraci may have changed their abode before
Ptolemy wrote, or their territory may have been smaller in
Caesar-'s time than in Ptolemy's. It is impossible to do more
than guess at the positions of the other two tribes ; foi· we have
no clue exce t doubtful similarity of names. The Latobrigi are
commonly p aced in the neighbourhood of Brugge, on the rivers
Brege and Briggach, tributaries of the upper Danube3 the
Tulingi in the country round Stilblingen, a town near Schaff·
hausen (Ο. 0., pp. 43842).

Lemonum, the chief town of the Pictones (viii, 26, ξ 1),
stood upon the site of Poitiers.
