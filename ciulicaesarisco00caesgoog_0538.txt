in the latter he had more than enough to do in suppress-
ing the insurrections of the tribes of North-Bastern Gaul ;
it seems to me incredible that a statesman who under-
stood so well what was possible should ever have dreamed
of embarking upon an impracticable and insane enterprise3
and if he returned from Germany because he dreaded the
machinatione of Cato or Domitius, some messenger must
have conveyed to Rome the news of his expedition and
from Rome to Germany the news of his enemies’ intentione,
for which movements there was not sufficient time.

On iv, 28, §§ 2-3

In the Classical Journal of 1911 (pp. 76-79) Mt.
Alfred R. Wightman discussed the passage (iv, 28, ἐξ 2-3)
in which Caesar describes what befell his cavalry trans·
ports, and incidentally criticized my explanation. Com·

· menting on the interpretation of tamen—‘notwithstand-

ing ' (the gale)—which 1 have given, in common with
Kraner·Dittenberger and other editors, Mr. Wightman
says that ⁴ the sailors . . . cast anchor . . . not because the
desirability of remaining off the coast of Britain was just
then uppermost in their minds, but because they were
under the instant need of . . . avoiding shipwreck'. I
maintain, on the contrary, that they cast anchor because
they purposed to remain in a position from which they
might be able, when the gale ceased, to reach their desti·
nation,—the coast of Britain, near ansar's camp. But,
says Mr. Wightmam ‘ if the storm was so violent that the
transports were falling to leeward in spite of all efforts to
hold them on their course [what efforts? Caesar does not
mention any.], one might naturally expect that when
rounded up and swung head to at anchor they would
pitch so heavily as to put their bows under.' No doubt
they did pitch heavily ; and no doubt this explains why,
as Caesar says, they ‘ were becoming water-logged ³ (flu-
ctibus complerentur).

Mr. Wightman then proceeds to deal with me. On
p. 319 of Ancicnt Britain I wrote, ‘The ships which
were swept down past the Foreland and the Dover cliffs
scudded before the north-easterly gale3 and although they
were evidently in no danger of being driven ashore, they
were in great peril because only the most watchful steer·
ing could prevent them from broaching toz if a heavy
sea struck the stern, it might swing the vessel round, and
