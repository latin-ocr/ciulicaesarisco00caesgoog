ATUATUCI -ATUATUOORUM OPPIDUM 409

ii, 29-33), it is possible that before their treachery provoked
his vengeance they may also have possessed a tract between
the Meuse and the Rhine: for they had ori inally settled
somewhere in this region (ii, 29, ἱξ 4-5) ; before aesar subdued
them they had compelled the E urones to pay tribute (v, 27,
ξ 2), which im lies that they were then strong and had

to the Eburones. Moreover. when we compare names, it seems
likely that Atuatuca, which in 54 Β. 0. belonged to the
Ebuggffiesshad originally belonged to the Atuatuci (0. G„
PpAtuatucorum oppidum—The Atuatuci possessed the
country round Namur and the district of Hesbaye ; and, before
Caesar attacked them, they may also have occupied some territory
on the right bank of the Mense. Besides this we have nothing
to help us in looking for their chief stronghold, except Cacsar's
description and his account of the siege. He says that the
place was ‘ a fortress of extraordinary natural strength ⁹, and
adds that ‘all round it presented a line of high rocks and steep
declivities, which at one point left 8 gently sloping a proach,
not more thau two hundred feet wide’ (ii, 29, §§ 2— ). The
fort was large enou h to shelter at least 57,000 people (33, §§ 5-
7), and the enti-ene ment with which Caesar surrounded it was
traced along ground com aratively high but of varying elevation
(33, ξ 2), and measured), according to the Mss„ 15 Roman
miles; but there is no doubt that the number was grossly ex-

they are 111 territory which did not belong to the Atuatuci.
Good jud s are now agreed that the choice lies between the
hill on w ich stands the citadel of Namur and Mont Falhize,
which is opposite Huy and about midway between Namur and
Lis e. This hill is within an easy walk from the railway station
1of οὔ, which may be reached by express train in 30 minutes
rom amur.

Both these sites are 0 011 to objection, auditis hard to decide ;
hut after carefully exp oring them 1 am inclined to prefer Mont
Falhize. The chief objection to Namur is that it appears much
too small. Its area is only about 27 acres, which would have
allowed little more than two square yards for each individual,
to say nothing of the numerous cattle (33, ξ 2) which they had
with them! It has, indeed, been argued that additional room
might have been gained if some of the garrison had encamped
011 the flanks of the hill ; but even so it would hardly have been
possible to find a ter space than 52 acres, or 40 square feet
for each man. Ι the hill had been covered by houses several
stories high, the Atuatuci might have had room ; but can we
believe that they were acked for days, like the crowd at the
Boat-race, along with t eir cattle, nearly four times as tightly
as the garrison of Alesia ⁸? Mol-cover, the only slope which can
be said to auswer at all to Gaesar's description can hardly be
called ‘ a gently sloping a proach ⁹ (leniter acclivis aditus):
Caesar’s entrenchment woul necessarily have been carried up
