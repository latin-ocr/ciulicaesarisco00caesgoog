COMMENTARIUS I 13

Helvetii iam per angustias et fines Sequanorum 11 'ruo

suas copias traduxerant et in Haeduorum fines per-

venerant eorumque agros populabantur. Haedui, 2

cum se suaque ab iis defendere non possent, legatos

6 ad Caesarem mittunt rogatum auxilium: ita se omni 3

tempore de populo Romano meritos esse ut paene in
conspectu exercitus nostri agri vastari, liberi [eorum]
in servitutem abduci, oppida expugnari non debuerint.

Eodem tempore (quo) Haedui Ambarri, necessarii et 4 .
10 consanguinei Haeduorum, Caesarem certiorem faciunt

sese depopulatis agris non facile ab oppidis vim

11, ξ Ῑ. Helvetii iam . . . pervenerant. The oute which the
Helvetii pursued‚ after threading the Pas de l' cluse (6, ξξ 1-2;
9,§ 1) to the Saone, cannot be traced exactly, but can be
roughly indicated if we can find out where they crossed the
river. They crossed it where it was so sluggish that one could
not tell, by merely looking, in which direction it was flowing
(12‚§ 1); and it answers most closely to this deseri tion in
that part of its course which lies between 'l'revoux and hoissey.
If the Helvetii crossed here, they had probably moved alon the
xggussvlgffilzafflnghph&iogeofflhfgrmzsdCpffigffirggdtghganstsgringceufeff
Grand, Tenay, and St. Rambert, and across the plateau of
Dombes. If, on the other hand, they crossed the Saone at
Macen, the doubtless followed the route which asses through
Chatillom antus, and Bourg. Macen is on e direct road
from the Pas de l'sscluse to Toulon-sur-Arroux‚ near which, as
we shall see in the note to 24, δ 1, the decisive battle of the
cam “ was fought; and M. Jullian argues that the Helvetii
coul only have found the necessary boats at a frequented spot.
But boats might surely have been found between Belleville and
Villefranche, which are both on great roads: such boats as the
Helvetii did find were not sufficient, for they used rafts as well
22,§1); and if they had crossed at a place so renowned as

acon (Matisco), which Caesar mentions in vii, 90, ξ 7, would
he not have said so ⁴? Mor-cover, the territory opposite Maeon on
the eastern bank of the river belon ed to the Ambarri ( . 4⁰6l:
if, then, the Helvetii had crossed at acon, Caesar woul sure y
have written in 10, ξ 5 not in Seyusiavos, but in Ambarros
(exercitum duxit). See C. G„ pp. 616-19.

ξ 8. Meusel (J. Β., 1910, p. 64) deletes eorum, because if there
were a ronoun‚ it ought to be sui, and even if eorum were
admissib e, it ought to follow ayra‘.

Ῠ 4. (quo) Haedui Ambarri. 'I'he MSS. have Haedui Ambarri
on y, which will not do, Accordin ly Meusel deletes Haedui ;
but, as he has justly remarked( . ., 1910, . 72), one cannot
see how the word could have been interpolateg, and accordingly
he was formerly inclined, as Ι am, to believe that quo, which is
supplied in the Aldine edition (1513), dropped out of the text.

Aedui,
Ambarri,
and Allo·

aid against

Helvetii.
