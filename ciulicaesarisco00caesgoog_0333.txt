sed magistratus ac principes in annos singulos genti-
bus cognationibusque hominum quique una coierunt
quantum et quo loco visum est agri attribuunt atque

dium belli gerendi agri cultura commutent3 ne latos
fines parare studeant, potentioresque humiliores pos-
sessionibus expellant3 ne accuratius ad frigora atque
aestus vitandos aedificent3 ne qua oriatur pecuniae

suas quisque opes cum potentissimis aequari videat.

ξ 2. nmqistmtus ac principes. The mayisimtus were evidentl
identical with the principes reqionum atque morum-⁴ the chie s
of the various districts and hundreds'—mentioned in 23, ξ 5;
and perhaps Schneider is right in believing that the mam‘stmtus
and the principes were the same. Klotz (Rh. M„ 1911, p. 631, n. 1)
holds that ac principes was added in orderto explain maymratue ;
but, as Schneider says, mayistratm requires no explanation,
and, if it d1d, the word principes, which sometimes denotes
{magistramss sometimes simply ‘leading meu ⁹, would not make

that, having used thgeu former in a {arrower senff than ’else-
where, e. g. in 17, ξ 2, he added the latter by way of explana-
tion. Gentibus is apparently used in the same sense as the
Roman Iulia yens; while cofflmtionibus means men who were
descended, or supposed to be descended, from a common
ancestor. ‘Clans and groups of kinsmen’ would, I think, be
a satisfactory translation. ι . ·

ξςέ. potenicbvlesffi. Ἠ. J. &tillet conjectures that Caesar
wrote (potentiores) atque, which would make it necessary to
take tentiam as the subject of aedificent in the next sentence.
See . Lange’s remarks in N.J.‚ cli, 1895, p. 815.

accuratius. Jurinius sup lied quam. Τὴθ emendation, which
is defendedby R. Schneider (J.·B.‚ 1895, pp. 141-2), may be
right3 but 1t seems to me gratuitous. cf. iv, 1, δ 10.

nascuntur. A. Polaschek (Serta Ηαντεῑῐαηα, 1896, p. 226)
proposes nascantur. 1 agree with R. Schneider (J. B„ 1897,
p. 235) that the emendation is not absolutely necessar53 sor
the remark may have been Caesar's own.

ξ4. aequitate is instrumental ablative, for if it were local
in would be required, and continere here means ‘to keep in
hand' or ‘to keep quiet ’. 1 translate ut . . .· contineant by
‘to keep the messes contented and therefore qmet '.
