tive, is understood fodinae, gust as we say ‘an express' when we
mean ‘ an express train '. chneider remarks that sectum was
added in order to explain aerariae to readers who were ignorant
of mining. I doubt whether, if they did not understand
aerariae, they would have understood sectarum and Ι believe
that Caesar added the word because there is a tendency in the
human mind to use two kindred words sometimes when one
would be enough. We all do it. Traces of one of the mines to
which Caesar alludes have been found at Sos, the site of the

Hirschfeld points out (S. P. A„ 1896, pp. 450-1), Nicolaus of
Damascus (mem. hist. Graec„ ed. Didot, iii, 418), who evi·
dently co led Caesar, says that these retainers were called
soldurii ‘ y the Gauls’ (ὑπὸ Γαλατῶν). Hirschfeld concludes
that Caesar wrote Galli. But it is not certain that soldurios is
Celtic3 and, as Caesar reckoned Aquitania as a part of Gallia,
Nicolaus may have regarded the Aquitani as Γιιλατηί.
