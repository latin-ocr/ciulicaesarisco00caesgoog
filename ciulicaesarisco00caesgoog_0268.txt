delete or bracket aut aet-23 but if ch. 12-14 were interpolated
by a late writer, the words may be genuine. On the other
hand, they may have crept into the text under the influence of
aere utuntur importato (ὅ 5).

nummo aureo· Numerous British gold coins have been dis-
covered. The earliest were struck about 150 years before
Caesar's invasionz and the types were derived mainly from
Gallio coins or through Gaul from coins of Philip of Macedon,
which had found their way into Gaul through the medium
of the Greek merchants of Massilia (Marseilles). Until about
30 Β. e. they were uninscribed (Α. B.. pp. 248-50).

taleis . . . nummo. A lar e number of these iron bars have
been unearthed; and one of t e hoards contained 394 specimens.
They may be arranged, according to their weight, insour groups,
the heaviest being twice as valuable as the next, four times as
valuable as the third, and eight times as valuable as the
lightest. Not a single bar has come to light in the eastern
and south-eastern countics, where coins are most abundant
(A. B., pp. 250-1; P. S. A„ xxii, 1907-9, pp. 338-43).

§ 5. in „tedium-aneis reqionibus. I can only account for this
mistake by the following suggestion. According to Strabo
(iii, 5, § 11), Publius Crassus— probably the Crassus who was
sent by Caesar in 57 Β. ο. to occupy Brittany (Β. G„ ii, 34)-
sailed to the Cassiterides‚ or ‘ tin-islands ⁹, and obtained informa·
tion about the tin-mining. If I am right in identifying the
cassiterides with the British Isles (A.B., pp. 483-98), Crassus
sailed from Brittany to Cornwall. He may have contented
himself with landing on the coast, where the tin was delivered
to the merchants: if so, he was doubtless informed that the tin
was actually won in the interior, as, in literal truth‚ it of course
was; and Caesar (or the writer of B.G., ν, 12-14) may have
concluded from his report that the mines were far from the
coast.
