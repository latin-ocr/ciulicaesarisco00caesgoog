COMMENTARIUS Ι 41

tanto suo populique Romani beneficio adfectu3‚ cum
in consulatu suo rex atque amicus a senatu appellatus
esset, hanc sibi populoque Romano gratiam referret
ut in conloquium venire invitatus gravaretur neque
5 de communi re dicendum sibi et cognoscendum pu-
taret, haec esse quae ab eo postularet: primum ne 3
quam multitudinem hominum amplius trans Rhenum
in Galliam traduceret3 deinde obsides quos haberet
ab Haeduis redderet Sequanisque permitteret ut quos
10 illi haberent voluntate eius reddere illis liceret; neve
Haeduos iniuria lacesseret neve his sociisque eorum
bellum inferret. Si [id] ita fecisset, sibi populoque 4
Romano perpetuam gratiam atque amicitiam cum eo
futuram ; si non impetraret, sese, quoniam M. Messala,

lieve that Caesar (and the Senate) had conferred upon Ariovistus
the titles of King and of Friend of the Roman People in order
to secure his neutrality in view of the threatened Helvetian
invasion. Caesar soresaw that when he went to Gaul he would
have to deal both with the Helvetii and with Ariovistus: and
to dispose of two formidable hosts separately would be quite as
much as he could manage. Guglielmo Fen-ero, the well-known
Italian historian, does not agree with me: he has argued that
Caesar made an ⁴ alliance ’ with Ariovistus in order to purchase
his aid a inst the Helvetii. I need only sa here that 11· Caesar
conferreffitles upon Ariovistus in order to o tain his aid against
the Helvetii, it is impossible ιο explain why he never availed
himself of it. It was as much as he could de, unaided‚ to defeat
the Helvetii ε why, then, did he not call upon Ariovistus tojoin
him ⁶? Obviously because he had never contemplated a pro·
ceeding which would paralyse his licy. If he had accepted
the aid of Ariovistus against the elvetii, it would have been
impossible sor him ιο turn round afterwards and expel Ariovistus
from Gaul. And that was what he meant to do ( C'. G„ pp. 218—24).

here, upon a historic present, the tenses of the subjunctive are

ξ 4. id is deleted by Meusel (J. B., 1910, p. 59), who remarks
that Caesar writes si ita secisse(n)t or si id fecisset, but not si id
ita fecisset. Probably the id was due to dittography‚—the
careless repetition of a word by a copyist in the same or nearly
the same form. Schneider, however, defends id,on the ground that
Caesar had to define his requirementsOas precisely as possible.
