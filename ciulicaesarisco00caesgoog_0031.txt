ΤΗΕ ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL xxv

to a great deal of discussion, about which 1 can say nothing
here, but of which I have given a short account in
Gaesar’s Conquest of Gaul (pages 290-8). There is another
fact which makes the Iberian question complicated and
difficult. Certain inscriptions, called Iberian, have been
found in Spain. Some of them are written in Rom‘an
letters; other in letters adapted from the Phoenician
alphabet, from right to left; others again in the same
letters from left to right. Nobody has yet been able to
translate them; but a French scholar who has devoted
his life to the study of Basque denies that any trace of
Basque is to be found in them. Moreover, the great
majority of the place-names in the Spanish peninsula and
in Seuthem Gaul which we find in the ancient road·
books¹ and in the writings of the ancient geographers
cannot be explained from Basque. Perhaps the problem
may be solved by supposing that Basques inhabited Spain
before the Iberians invaded it ; that they were the founders
of Iliberris, of Elimberri, and of Illiberri 3 and that before
the time of Caesar they had been driven by the Iberians‚
who probably spoke the languages of the inscriptions,
into the region where Basque is still spoken.

'I'he Greek geographer, Strabo, says that the Aqui·
tanians resembled the Iberians (by whom he means the
mass of the inhabitants of the entire Spanish peninsula,
not merely of the part which belonged to Iberians pro·
perly so called) rather than the Gauls, and spokea
language akin to that of the former. What ιβ certain
is that, except Aquitania, the region inhabited by Iberians
and Ligurians was subdued, long before the time of Caesar,
by Oelts.

It is now time to speak of the Galli, or, as they called
themselves, Celtae, and of the Belgae. I have said ⁴
enough to show that each of these two groups was
a mixture of various races‚—that the Celtic and Belgic
invaders had given their names to a population which
comprised descendants of palaeolithic and neolithic taces,
and of later invaders. Several questions have to be
answered. When did the invaders who gave their name
