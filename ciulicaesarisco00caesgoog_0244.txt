§2 castris. Ten years ago (1902), aster spending two days
in examining the coast between Kingsdown and Sandown Castle,
1 concluded that the camp must have been either on the plateau
between Walmer Gastle and Kingsdown or, much more probably,
on the rising ground, north-west of the plateau, which is now
covered by part of Walmer. On opening the second volume of
Na oleon s Ηίεεοὶνε de Jules clear, 1 found that Colonel Stoffel
h adopted the latter alternative. Unfortunately it would be
impossible to test our choice by excavation; for the ground is
covered with buildings (A. Β., pp. 673-4, 737).

tanta tempestas . . . deicerentur. The ships that were swe t
down Channel (deicerentur) were in great peril because on y

carrying only just enough sail to keep them stea y (A.B.,
pp. 319, 582, 651, 740-1).

ξ 3. tamen refers to magma . . . deicerentur and is closely con·
nected with ancoris iactis. The meaning is ‘they anchored
notwithstanding ’ (the danger the were in). See pp. 442-6.

adversa nocte. According to Sc neider‚ adversa is equivalent
to obstante,—‘ bein unfavourable ' ; but if so, did Caesar mean
that the ships stoo out to sea thouyh ni ht was unfavourable to
the voyage, or because it was unfavoura le to their re ' ⁹
where the were ⁵? 1 unhesitatingly reject the former alterna·
tive‚ for l Caesar's voyages between Gaul and Britain were
made by night, and, moreover‚ on this particular night there
was a full moon: on the other hand, it would not have been
more dangerous to remain at anchor in the night than in the
day-time. I agree with Kraner·Dittenberger, who hold that
just as advene colle (ii, 19,§ 8) means‘ up the hssl', and adom
flumine (vii, 60, § 3) ‘up the river ⁹, so adrem: nocto means ‘in
the face of night ’, a translation which reminds one of Brown·
