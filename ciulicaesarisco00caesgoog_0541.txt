APPENDIX. 445

they did not want to be driven into the Atlantic and did
want to land the cavalry. ‘ If ’, Mr. Wightman continueS,
‘ there was plenty of sea-room . . . no real sailor, having
once started to run before the wind, would ever think of
casting anchor except he had got into some sheltered posi-
tion.’ Precisely what these Gallie sailors had done3 that
is to say, they had got into a commoratively sheltered posi·
tion. There are several points off the southern coast of
Kent where, owing to the high ground, the force of a
north-easterly gale would have been in some measure
broken, though, as it turned out, the shelter was not
enough. But, Mr. Wightman insists, ‘to anchor was a
blunder, and blunder number two if the vessels had really
been running before the wind, for by so doing the ship-
masters had not only wasted time and effort but had put
themselves in a position which, as regards laying their
course back to the continent, was much worse than that
they occupied when it came on to blow. They were now
forced to close-haul from a point just so much further dead
to leeward. Compared with their fellows in the other
group of transporta what a mess they had made of it·—
according to ΜΓ. Holmes.'

Yes and, what is more important, according to Caesar.
Certainly to anchor was a blunder, in the sense that it
was an attempt which failed,—a blunder which the 6 ship-
masters ⁹ committed because they clung to the hope of
being able to achieve the objectos their voyage by landing
the cavalry, which Caesar was anxiously awaiting. How
much further to leeward they were when they began ‘to
close-haul ’ we do not know,—perhaps not more than a
few miles; and since they got safely back to the conti-
nent, what did it matter ’ἲ But what is truly amazing is
that Mr. Wightman fails to see that if, as he maintains‚
they did not commit this 6 blunder ’ and if, as he implies,
the vessels had not ‘really been running before the wind ',

, they acted in exactly the same way as 6 the other group of

transports ’, whereas it is clear from Caesar's narrative
that they acted quite differently. The only way of escape
open to Mr. Wightman is to suppose that the 6 ship-
masters ⁹, with their eyes open, allowed their ships to
drift helplessly towards ‘some danger point to leeward ’,
but at last, when the danger of striking became imminent,
woke up and put them on the other tack! Let us see how
ΜΓ. Wightman absolves them from the charge of having
‘made a mess of it ’. 6 Ι venture ', he sayS, ‘to suggest
that anchors were not thrown out at all 3 that the ablative
absolute [ancoris Motis] here puts a hypothetical case
merely ; that tamen sets over against their [the seamen's]
