that this passage is out of place and originally stood in ξ 3
after pertinentem while Meusel (J. Β., 1910, pp. 46-7), following
Mommsen, who says (ib., 1894, p. 207) that, in its existing
context, it must mean ‘ Everything is done in order to make the
march as dangerous as possible and to tire out the soldiers
beforehand' (Ξ), and who regards it as a ‘scathing rebuke’
of Sabinus, condemns it altogether as an interpolation. Ι do
not agree with either of these views, and Ι subjoin my own
translation of ξς 4-5, to show how naturally the passage reads
as it stands:—‘ An order was issued that the troops were to
march at daybreak. 'l'he men stayed up for the rest of the
night, every one looking about to see what he could take
with him, what part of his winter's kit he would be forced
to leave behind. Men thought of every argument to persuade
themselves that they could not remam wlthout danger, and
that the danger would be increased by protracted watches
and consequent exhaustion,' &c (C. G„ pp. 726-7).

ξ 6. esset. The subjunctive is causal.

Ambioriye is rightly deleted by Meusel (J. Β., 1910, . 62).

33. § 1. pmm'disset. In English the force of the su junctive
can be suggested :—‘ And now Titurius, having exercised no
forethought, lost all nerve,' &c.
