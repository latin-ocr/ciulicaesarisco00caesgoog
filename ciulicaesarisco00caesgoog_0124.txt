50 DE BELLO GALLICO

umquam dubitasse neque timuisse neque de summa
belli suum iudicium sed imperatoris esse existima-

4 visse. Eorum satisfactione accepta et itinere exquisito

per Diviciacum, quod ex Gallis ei maximam fidem

habebat, ut milium amplius quinquaginta circuitu 5

locis apertis exercitum duceret, de quarta vigilia, ut

5 dixerat, profectus est. Septimo die, cum iter non

intermitteret, ab exploratoribus certior factus est

Ariovisti copias a nostris milia passuum IIII et XX
abesse.

42 Cognito Caesaris adventu Ariovistus legatos ad

eum mittit: quod antea de conloquio postulasset, id
per se fieri licere, quoniam propius accessisset seque

2 id sine periculo facere posse existimaret. Non respuit

which accords with the supposition that the 3rd cohort ranked
below the first tw0‚ but above all the rest. A passage in Tacitus
(Hist., iii, 22) shows that in the time of the Emperor Galba
there were not less than six pre'morum ordinum centuriones in
the 7th legion. Lastly, it is proved by inscriptions that the
centurione of the lst cohort known as primus pilus pm'or, primus
{gifflssffissrzssnflgigllssffnfflss‘Zitss'sstfiroffssgfusissss {wag
4th, 5th, and 6th centurione of the lst cohort also ranked above
all the centurione of the other cohorte.

Ι am, however, inclined to believe that besides the six centu·
rions of the lst cohort there were occasionally others who ranked

the chief centurione of their respective legions ; and he mentions
them in a way which shows that they were still respected by
the men just as much as if they had still been chief centurione.
Perhaps they were evocati, that ιε to say, men who had compleaed
their term of service, and were serving again as volunteers: any-
how it seems not improbable that they would have ranked with
the primorum ordinum centuriones (C. G„ pp. 567-79).

§4. ut milium am lius . . . duceret can only mean that the
circuitous part of t e march was 50 Roman miles long; and
this is just what it would have been if Diviciacus had conducted
Caesar by the natural route which Stoffel indicated, namely, the
road that leads past Vol-ay, Rioz, Filain‚ and Vallerois·le-Bois,
to Villersexel. and thence to Belfort. In regat-d to amplius see
the note on 38, ξ 5.

ξ 5. cum iter non intemu'tleret. As these words imply, it was
usual to give troops a day's rest occasionally; but evidently
Caesar wished to lose no time before encountering Ariovistus.

I cannot explain why Caesar wrote postularet, accessisset, and
