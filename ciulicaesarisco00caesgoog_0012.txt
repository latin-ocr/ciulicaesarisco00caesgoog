vi PREFACE

when he was High Master of Manchester Grammar
School he read the whole work with his best pupils.
Apart from the mere interpretation of the Latin,
which requires far more scholarship than is commonly
supposed, the book demands, forits fullcomprehension,
at least such an elementary knowledge of Roman
history as may be acquired from the late Professor
Pelham's masterly Outlines. Furthermore, it demands
intelligence sufficiently developed to understand the
exposition of ethnological, social‚ religious‚ and political
questions; and this demand can hardly be satisfied
by the Fourth Form.

In conclusion let me translate an extract from
a letter relating to Caesar, which Mommsen wrote in
1894 to Dr. Heinrich Meusel :—‘ The noble work
deserves all the labour that can be spent upon it.
The enormous difference between these Commentaries
and everything else that is called Roman History
cannot be adequately realized.'
