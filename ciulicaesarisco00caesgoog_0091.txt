He vetii had struck off from the Saone (iter ab Arga· . . . aver*-
temnt); and though he does not tell us when they bc to
move away, his words seem to imply that for some lit e time
they had marched up the valley. If they had diverged from it
at Belleville‚ they would have found themselves walled in
between abrupt lulls, on the flanks cf which it would have been
impossible to de loy. They must, then, have struck westward
near Macom an as the scene of the decisive battle (see the
note to 24, ξ 1) was near Toulon-sur-Arroux‚ Colonel Stoffel was
able to determine their route. From the nei hbourhood of
Magon they followed the line of the road which eads tQAutun
b? way of Cluny, Salornay, and Mont St. Vincent‚ and thence
turned westward past Sanvi e to Toulon-sur·Arroux (C. G„

route was far more difficult and indeed would have been im-
practicable for waffins (0. G„ pp. 50, 232),

16‚§ 1. essene. e subjunctive of course shows that quod . . .
polliciti is not a mere statement of fact. In order to give the‘
sense of such subjunctives in good English one has to think hard.
Here I should say ‘ (the grain which‚) as 116 reminded them,
(they had promised) ', διο.

ξ 2. quod Gallia . . . posita est. If 1, ἕξ 5-7, were interpolated‚
it 1s obvious that these words were also,

flumenta. Τ116 plural always denotes standing corn.

ξ 4. Diem is an accusative of time, the object of ducere bein
Caesarem understood 3 and Diem ex die ducere may be transla
by ‘From day to day the Aedui kept him on the expectant ⁹.
Similarly Cicero writes to Atticus (vii, 26, ΞΒ), Tibi autem . . .
