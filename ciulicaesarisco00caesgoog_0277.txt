penderet. See the note on iv, 14, ξ 2 (praestaret). Mommsen
(H. R„ v, 66) says ‘it is certain that the stipulated tribute was
never paid’,-—a mere assertion which is not only im robable,
but is opposed to such evidence as we possess (Α. B„ p. 56). No
doubt payment was stopped after Caesar left Gaul; but Mommsen
did not fully appreciate the hold which he could exert over
Cassivellaunus through hostaqes. Hostages in those days were
meant to be used. Besides, w en Caesar was disobeyed, he said
so frankly (iv, 38, ξ 4).

ξ 5. interdicit atque impetat means ‘strictly forbids ’, imperat
bem added to strengthen interdicit. Schneider is surely wrong
in li enin this expression to praecipit atque interdicit (58, 4),
sor there t e troops were ordered to do one thing and sorbi den

to do another.

23,§ 1. exercitum . . . mare. Caesar omitted to mention that,
escorted probably by a small flying column, he had made an
earlier visit to the coast on or before the lst of September (the
5th of August of the Julian calendar). This is attested by
a letter which he wrote on that day to Marcus Cicero (Q. fr„ ii1,
1, ξ 25). Perhaps he desired to see for himself that the
defences of tbe naval camp (22, ξ 1) were secure against any
future attack, to reinforce the rrison, and to ascertain what
progress had been made in t e repair of the flect (A.I>·.,
pp. 348-9, 672, 731-3).
