128 DE BELLO GALLICO

materiam quae erat caesa conversam ad hostem con-
locabat et pro vallo ad utrumque latus extruebat.

2 Incredibili celeritate magno spatio paucis diebus con-

fectO, cum iam pecus atque extrema impedimenta a
nostris tenerentur, ipsi densiores silvas peterent, eius 5
modi sunt tempestates consecutae uti opus necessario
intermitteretur et continuatione imbrium diutius sub

3 pellibus milites contineri non possent. Itaque vastatis

omnibus eorum agris, vicis aedificiisque incensiS,
Caesar exercitum reduxit et in Aulercis Lexoviisque‚ ιο
reliquis item civitatibus quae proxime bellum fecerant,
in hibernis conlocavit.

29, ξ 2. diutius . . . possent. We might infer that the troops
litgedugn huts4gn§tllie wmter, even if the fact were not expressly
s m v, ‚ .

et . . . non. See the note on 25, ξ 1 (ac non). Doubtless Caesar
wrote et . . . non instead of noque in order to emphasize the
nc tion.

3. reliquis . . . civitatibus. If this were to be understood
literally‚ it would mean that divisione of the army were
quartered not only in the territories of the Veneti and all the
tribes of Brittany and Normandy who had helped them against
Caesar, but also in A uitania. But this, as we may infer from
iv, 6, ξ 1, was not t e case. R. Menge is perhaps right in
conjecturing that Caesar wrote not Lexoviis-que, reliquis, but
Lexoviis reliquisque.
