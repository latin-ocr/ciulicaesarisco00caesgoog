THE ETHNOLOGY OF GAUL xxi

classified them in various groups, not forgetting to note
the surroundings in which they were found; they have
also taken very numerous observatione of the height,
hair, eyes and complexim, and skull-form of living
Frenchmen‚ Belgians‚ and others, in the hope that the
results would help them to give a true account of the
population of ancient 68111, Τ119 archaeologists have
collected, arranged, and described the tools, weapons,
and ornaments which were found with or apart from the
skeletons, and have thereby been able to fix the period of
681119 history or the prehistoric period to which this or
that skeleton or group of skeletons belonged. Thus
some skeletons have been found interred with stone
knives‚ others with bronze daggers, others with iron
swords, bronze brooches, chariot-wheeIS, and horse·
trappings of various kinds. The philologists have en·
deavoured to learn from names of tribes and places and
from the scanty remains of the Iberian and Ligurian
languages whether the Iberians and Ligurians, whom
Caesar ignored, inhabited other parts of Gaul besides
those which ancient writers assigned to them, and have
also used the remains of the old Celtic languages in order
to find out whether 1119 091189 811 spoke the same lan·
guage or formed two groups which spoke two dialects,
how they were related to the Belgae, and how both were
related to the 6911118113.

Before Ι proceed let me ask the reader to bear in mind
two things. First, Caesar uses 1119 words ⁴ Oelts ’ (Celtae)
and ‘Gauls' (Galla) in a restricted sense. As we shall
see presently‚ the Belgae were 681113 and 09113 as well as
the Celtae: there had been Celts in Germany before he
came to Gaul ; there were Celts'in Britain and in Spain;
the Gauls who beat the Romans in the battle of the Allia ¹
were 09113. Secondly, Belgae, Celtae, and Aquitani were
all, more or less, mixed. No pure race exists. ll

Let us begin at the beginning. 'I‘he oldest human
fossils that have been found in Gaul belong to the
Palaeolithic Age. Not only Gaul, but also Belgium and
Gentral Europe as far 9831 83 Oroatia were then inhabited
