cum fremitu et concursu significaretur, milites nostri 5
pristini diei perfidia incitati in castra inruperunt.

Caesar uses the imperfect in indirect questions after a historic
present (J. B„ 1894, p. 354).

reader to notice the tremendous frankness of this avowal. The
man of whom Dicere, who did not love him, said (Fam, vi, 6,

importance to their military standards as we used ιο do to
regimental colours. cf. vii, 2, ξ 2; 88, ξ 4. The German
standards, like those of the Gauls, were figures of animale which
in rehistoric times had been sacred.

2. ad confluentem Mosae et Rheni. These words present so
much difficulty that some commentatore believe that Caesar
wrote Mosellae or Mosulae (the Mosella), while others suggest
that et Rheni is spurious.

To begin with, it is doubtful whether confluentem Mosae et
Rheni means ‘ the confluence of the Mense and the Waal ’ (is it
does, Rheni cannot mean the Rhine properly so called) or ⁸ the
stream that connected the Mense with the Rhine ⁹. If it means
the latter, confluentem denotes the Waal. When Caesar 'oined
his army he learned that the Germans, aster crossing the hine,
had wandered southward and ‘reached the territorias of the
Eburones and Condrusi ’ (6, ἕξ 1-4). The Condrusi (see . 415)
inhabited Condroz; so the Germane must have advanced urther
southward than Liege. Caesar, as soon as his preparatione were
