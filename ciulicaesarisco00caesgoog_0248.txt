166 DE BELLO GALLICO

equorum et strepitu rotarum ordines plerumque per-
turbant, et cum se inter equitum turmas insinua-
verunt, ex esoedis desiliunt et pedibus proeliantur.
2 Aurigae interim paulatim ex proelio excedunt atque
ita currus conlocant ut, si illi a multitudine hostium 5
premantur, expeditum ad suos receptum habeant.
3 Ita mobilitatem equitum, stabilitatem peditum in
proeliis praestant, ac tantum usu cotidiano et exer-
citatione efficiunt uti in declivi ac praecipiti loco
incitatos equos sustinere et brevi moderari ac flectere ιο
et per temonem percurrere et in iugo insistere et se
inde in currus citissime recipere consuerint.

‘just as nowadays cavalry rotect the limbering up and un1
hmbering of the horse-arti lery associated with them.' The
reasons which he gives are that Caesar had no cavalry [or
rather, only 30 troopers (35, § 1)] in this campaign, and that if
the British warriors had penetrated between troops of hostile
cavalry, they would not have been able to get on to the chariots
‘n, as Caesar ( 2) says that they did A.B.‚ pp. 676-7).

ommsen (J. B., 1 94, p. 205), followed by eusel, co ‘ectures
that Caesar wrote not equitum turmas but omines. He oes not,
however, offer any argument in su port of this needless altera·
tion or any theory to account for t e presence in the MSS. of
equitum turmas. Besides, any one who has read v, 16, 2 will
see that the charioteerswould not have attached unbroken egions.

ξ 2. According to Tacitus (Ayricola, 12), the drivers were
hi her in rank than the warriors‚ who were their retainers.

3. usu . . . exercitatione. J. Lange (N. J., cliii, 1896, p. 713)

may be right in substituting usu et cotidiana exercitatione.

sustinere does not mean, as some editors with no practical
experience explain, to ‘ check ’ the horses (which is here ex-
pressed b moderari), but ‘to kee (them) m hand ', so as to
prevent t eir stumbling. Ι trans ate ac tantum . . . consuerint

34, 1. perturbatis nostris is, Ι believe, dative, but Ι am not
sure: chneider regards it as ablative.
