pumque liberos obsides ad se adduci iussit. Quae 5

‘I'he subject of arbitrari is of course se, supplied from ξ 4,
and XL milia is governed by posse conficere, supplied from ξ 5, not
by ΡοΙΙίι-ετϊς for in the latter case the Remi would not have been
doubtful about the number. But the omission of se and posse
conficere is so extremely harsh that there is erhaps a gap in
the MSS. (J.B., 1894, pp. 337-8). Mommsen in ers from arbitrare*
tlfiatghp rso-called Germani took no part in the council (ξ 4) of
t e e .

Accorgcsllgg to the estimato with which the Remi supplied
Caesar, the sum of the contingents which the various tribes
had promised to furnish amounted to 296,000 men. Caesar
does not guarantee the accuracy of this number; but neither
does he question it. Various critice have insisted that it is
grossly exaggerated3 and there is some ground for their scep-
ticism. For, supposing that the proportion of fightin men to
women and children was about the same as in the elvetian
host (i, 29, §§ 2-3), the hundred thousand men whom the
Bellovaci are said to have been able to muster would have
represented a population almost as great as that which now
inhabits their country; and, moreover, the contingente of the
Bellovaci, Suessiones, and Nervii are said to have amounted to
considerably more than half of the entire force, whereas their
territories were only about one-fourth of the whole. Allowance
must, however, be made for the greater fertility of their
country. 1 am inclined to believe that none of the tribes sent.
into the field as many men as they had promised; and 1 doubt
whether the Nervii and their allies (16, §§ 1-2) took any part
in the first stage of the campaign, and whether the more distant
tribes fought at all (C. G„ pp. 241-2).

Caesar's eight legions, with his auxiliaries and cavalry, proba·
bly did not number much more than 40,ooo men. See the note
” οη i. 7, ' 2.

5, ξ 1. Caesar . . . prosecutus may be translated by ‘ Caesar
Ἑάᾞθςεῖἒ ῐέῗ Remi in encouraging and gracious terms'. Cf.

principum seems to mean simpl ‘leading men '; it does not,
as for instance in vii, 65, ξ 2 andy 88, ξ 4, denote magistrates.
Some of the principes, whom Caesar frequently mentions, were
certainly magistrates, and perhaps these were ; but the word, as
such, rarely bears that meaning. cf. the second note on i, 3, ξ 5.
