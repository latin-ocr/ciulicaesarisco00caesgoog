have carried the grain. Of the former, 160 in single
file would have covered a mile; of the latter 117 (The
Soldier’s Pocket-Book, p. 340). Thus the length of the
wagon·train in single file would have been from 68 to
88 miles. Moving four abreast (see the note on i, 29, ξ 3),
they would have occupied from 17 to 22 miles, and after
the defeat of the rear-guard from 13 to 17.¹ We must,
however, allow at least 20 per cent. for inevitable opening
cut (The Soldicr’s haket-Book, p. 324); so let us say from
16 to 21. The length of the column of emigrante, if all
had gone on foot and marched‚ like a modern army on a
fenced road, four abreast, would have been, after the defeat
of the rear-guard, with due allowance for opening out, about
45 miles. But the modern army is obliged to leave room
for the passage of orderlies, vehicles, διο. ; and we may be
sure that the Helvetii marched with a much broader frent.
In open country Roman armies occasionally marched in a
quadratum amnon—baggage train flanked on either side by
infantry—and sometimes, as Polybius says (vi, 40, §§ 10-
12), in three parallel columns. Moreover‚ many of the
emigrants may have tramped alongside of the wagons, as
VVellington's troops did in their retreat from Quatre Bras
(Hamley, Operations of War, p. 29); and as the wagons
becagne emptied, women and children would have ridden
in t em.

But Professor Delbruck will not admit that several
wagons moved abi-east (see Caesar-’3 conquest of Gaul, p. 239).
He insists that they must have moved in single file,
not only on account of defiles (see the note on 29, ξ 3),
but also because the roads were bad and discipline was lax.
Ῑ do not think that these reasons are sufficient. When
Caesar says (i, 6, ξ 1) that the defile between the J ura and
the Rhene ‘ was so narrow and difficult that carts could
barely pass along it one at a time ², does he not imply
that elsewhere they could move abreast Ῥ Wagons can
go two abreast on almost all roads (Soldier’s Perstet-Book,
p. 408); oxen can draw wagons where there are no roads
(ἰὰ, p. 78) ; and Gallic roads were at all events good enough
to allow large numbers of wagons to travel over them not-
withstanding disorder and lack of discipline (viii, 14,
ξ 2 ; Β. 0., i, 51, §§ 1-2). Α bad road, wide enough to
allow two or more wagons to move abreast, will present
the same obstacles to one file of wagons as to tw0. Perhaps
