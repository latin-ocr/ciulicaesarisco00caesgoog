AM BARRI—ATUATUCA 407

degalffiment of tho Maine-etLoire and part of the Sarthe (Ο. G„

Aquileia was on the northern coast of the Adriatic, about
25 miles west by north of Tergeste (Trieste).

Aram—The river Saone.

Aremoricae (civitates). Aremoricus means ‘maritime ’.
In vii, 75, ξ 4 Caesar says that the Aremorican states bordered
on the sea, and mentions eight of them—the Coriosolites,
Redones, Ambibarii, Caleti, Osismi, Veneti, Lexovii, and
Venelli—all of whom, except the Caleti, who were on the

tribes south of the Loire as Aremorican,yfor in 75, ξ 3 he
mentions the Pictones and Santoni, who possessed the seaboard
between the Loire and the Garonne, separately; nor, ap a·
rently, did he include under this head any tribe east of t e
Calefi, for in the same chapter he mentions the Morini, who
dwelt between the Canche and the Scheldt, separately. Evi-
dently, then, according to Gaesar's informante, all the
Aremorican tribes, except the Caleti, were between the Loire
and the Scine (0. G„ pp. 370-1).

Arverni.—The country of the Arverni comprised the de rt·
ments of the Cantal and Puydc-Dome and parts of those o the
Allier and Loire-Superieure (0. G„ p. 371).

Atrebatem—The territory of this tribe corresponded with
the diocese of Arras‚ that is to say, the south-eastern pant of
the department of the Pas-decalais and the adjacent part os the
department os the Nord (C. G„ p. 371).

Atuatuca was the place where Titurius Sabinus and Aurun-
culeius Cotta encamped in the autumn of 54 Β. 0., and close to
which their army was destro ed by Ambiorix, one of the two
kings of the Eburones (v, 24, ξω 26-37 ; vi, 32, §§ 3-4). .

Atuatuca is generally identified with Tongres, 12 miles
NW. by N. of Liege. ΤΙιθ reasons are, first, that Tongres was
undoubtedly the site of a Gallo-Roman fortress called Atuaca,
which is mentioned in the Table of Peucinyer( . 12, col. 1) and
which Ptolemy called Ἀτουάτουκοι·; secondly, t at this fort was
situated, as the camp of Sabinus and Cotta probably was, at
the junction of great roads; thirdly, that Atuatuca was in the
kingdom of Ambiorix, which formed the western part of the
territory of the Eburones, and which may have been se arated
from the kingdom of his colleague, Catuvolcus, by the euse;
and lastly, that nobody has succeeded in finding another site
which corresponds satisfactorily with Caesar’s narrative. There
are, however, strong arguments against identifying Atuatuca
with Tongres. When Caesar said that Atuatuca ‘is nearly in
the centre of the territory of the Eburones' (sere estin mediis
Eburonum finibus [vi, 32, §4]), he could hardly have meant
what his words appear, at first sight, to convey3 for neither
Tongres nor any other place which could reasonably be identi-
fied with Atuatuca is near the centre of that territory :oprobabl y
he meant that Atuatuca was near the common frontier of the
two kin doms of which the whole territory was com osed. But
it is di cult to believe that he would have used t e words in
mediis Eburonum finibus to indicate a site which lay 10 miles
