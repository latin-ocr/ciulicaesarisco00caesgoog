366 DE BELLO GALLICO

Ita cum duabus legionibus ad persequendos Carnutes

4, ξ 2. cum ius diecret is a most significant remark, and its
importunae has not been appreciated. It shows that in Gaul
Caesar πε not merely a. conqueror but also an administrator,
and that, although the conquered country had not yet been
formally annexed or its constitution settled, cmm performed
the duties of a. judge there ss he did in the Cisalpine province
(i, 54, ξ 3; v, 1, ᾗ 5; vi, 44, ξ 3) and in Illyricum (v, 1‚§ 5-9).

ξ 3. VI. Caesar nowhere mentions the eth legion, t ough,
as Hirtius says, it was one of the two which, immediately after
the capture of Alesia, he had sent into winter-quartem on the
Saone (vii, 90, ξ 7). He had ten legions in 52 Rc. (vi, 44, ξ 3 ;
vii, 34, 2): one of them, which he hed horrowed from Pompey
(vi, 1, ξ 2-3 ‚ was numbered I (viii, 54, ξ 2) ; the remaining nine
were the ‘It , 8th, 9th, loth, 11th, leth, 13th, l4th‚ and 15th
(ii, 23; vi, 32, §53 vii, 51‚§2; viii‚54‚ 53). It would seem,
then, at first sight that he had eleven legions in 52 ne„ before
the siege of Alesia,—the ten that have just been enumerated
and the 6th. But first impressione are sometimes wrong. There
is reason to believe that the let legion was identical with the
6th,—that it was eslled the eth so long as it remained with
Caesar, but when it beoeme part of Pompey's army the lst-
For if any oue will compare viii,54, ξ 3 with B. 0., iii, 88, ξ 1, he
will see that Caesel-’s 15th legion, which he was obliged in
50 Β. c. to hand over to Pom , was numbered III in the army
of the latter3 and, besideei Caesar hsd raised the eth himself,
and not borrowed it from Pompey, he would most probably have
numbered it consecutively, as he did all the others, and ealled
it the 16th. Anyhow it is certain that Caesar had only ten
legions at Alesia; sor he expressly says (vii, 65, 4) that,
before he attaeked it, he could get no reinforcements m Italy
or the Provinee because the roadswere bloeked (0. G„ pp. 802—4).
