310 DE BELLO GALLICO

interficere potuisset, tribusque horis [noctis] exercitui

fere itinere equites a Fabio missi quanto res in
periculo fuerit exponunt. Summis copiis castra

oppugnata demonstrant, cum crebro integri defessis ⁵

succederent nostrosque adsiduo labore defatigarent,
quibus propter magnitudinem castrorum perpetuo

4 menta. Fabium discessu eorum duabus relictis portis

obstruere ceteras pluteosque vallo addere et se in

cognitis Caesar summo studio militum ante ortum solis
in castra pervenit.

41, 1. noctis, as von Goler (G.K., 1880, p. 274, n. 3) first
pointe out, was certainly interpolated,—-by a dunce- If the
three hours’ rest had been taken in the night, there would not
have been time to march back to Gergovia (see ξ 5). ‘nse
interpolator was doubtless misled by the words ad quietem datis,
and did not pause to think. See J. Β., 1910, pp. 64-5.

ad Gerqoviam. See the note on i, 7, ξ 1 (ad Genavam).

ξ 2. Summis, as in v, 17, ξ 5, is equivalent to universis or
cunctis.

succederent . . . defaiiaamt . . . esset. See the second paragraph
of the note on i, 35, ξ 2.

§ 3. omnis gener-is. Meusel (J. Β., 1894, p. 285) adopts the
reading of B—omni qaum—remarking that Caesar writes omni
⁸venere telomm (Β. C„ i, 26, ξ 1), omni ymen amorum (Β. G„ iii,
14, ξ 2), commeatus omni genere B. 6., iii, 49, ξ 6), and omne
‚oenus cuniculorum (B. G„ vii, 22, 2), but nowhere else speaks
of amna, tela, &c.‚ omnis quaem. But these passages are
irrelevant if, as 1 believe, telorum depende upon multitudine.

tormenta. See the second note on ii, 8, ξ 4.

§ 4. eorum is enerally and, 1 think, rightly taken as meaning
{Ithehenemy'—t e Gauls who had been attacking Fabius—not

e orsemen.

duabus . . . ceteras. See the notes on iii, 19, ξ 2 and v, 49, ξ 7.
Fabius's motive for leaving two of the gates open was evidently
a resolve to make a sortie if the worst should come to the
worst.

pluteos. These were breastworks used as an extraordinary
defence. cf. 25, 1 and 72, ξ 4 (where plutei yhich strenffined
the earthworks t at Caesar construet-ed during the bloc e of
Alesia are described).

ad similem casum. The reading of a is similemque casum, of
