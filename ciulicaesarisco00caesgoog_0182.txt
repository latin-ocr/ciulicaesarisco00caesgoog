invariably uses t e present subjunctive: here, as Meusel
remarks (J. B., 1894, p. 355). the imperfect, {nter-mitterent, is
justified by the immediately preceding imperfect, experirentur.

sui colliqendt‘ means ‘ of closing their ranks’. Notice that,
although sm· is plural, the gerundive is singular, because the
genitive lural of se is identical in form with the genitive
singular L. 0., iii, 1968-9). No Italian would have written sui
wlliymdorum. Madvig, however (Lat. Gr„ §§ 2971), 417), who
denies (ξ 85) that the reflexive pronoun has a genitive, takes sui
as the neuter singular of the possessive (suus).

§2 intercipiunt is an emendation, roposed by J. Lange
(N. J., cli, 1895, . 799) instead of the S. readin , interficiunt.

Nantuates, Ve eduni, and Viberi was only 81,559; and 1t
is therefore unli ely that the Seduni and Vemffl (2, ξ 1) could
muster more than 10,000 fighting men. Gal , says Ernest
Desjardins, must have misled Caesar. 1 should say that he was
also misled himself (see the note on 26, § 6 and G. G„ p. 678).
