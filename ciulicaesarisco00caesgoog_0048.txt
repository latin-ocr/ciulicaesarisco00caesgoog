Gaul and

xlii INTRODUCTION

The Province which was now formed stretched from
the Maritime Alps to the Rhon03 but the frontier was
rapidly extended until it ran along the Cevennes and the
river Tarn down into the centre of the Pyrenees. The
Gallio tribes were obliged to pay tribute and to furnish
troops 3 and, although, in accordance with Roman princi·
ples, they were permitted to retain their own forms of
government, their subjection was assured by the con·
struction of roads and fortresses. The heavy exactions
of the conquerors provoked frequent insurrections; but
year by year the Provincials became steadily Romanized.
Roman nobles acquired estates in the Province, and sent
their stewards to manage them. Roman merchants built
warehouses and countmffhousae in the towns3 and the
lang-uage and civilization of Rome began to take root.
Narbo with its spacious harbour was not only a powerful
military station, but in commerce the rival of Massilia.
Nor was the activity of the Romans confined to the Pro·
vince itself. Catamantaloedis, King of the Sequani,
whose territory lay north of the Allobroge3‚ received
from the Senate the title of Friend ς and the same honour
was bestowed upon an Aquitanian noble and upon Ollo-
vico, King of the Nitiobroges, who ruled the upper valley
of the Garonne. These distinctions were doubtless
prized as much by Gallio chieftains as the title of Knight
Commander of the Star of India by an Indian prince of
our own time. For what services they were conferred,
we do not know; but events were already paving the
way for the conquest of the great country that stretched
beyond the Rhene and the Cevennes to the Rhine and
the Atlantic Ocean.

familiar. The land of gay cities, of picturesque old
towns dominated by awful cathedrale, of cornfields and
vineyards and sunny hamlets and smiling chateaux‚ was
then covered in many places by dreary swamps and
darkened by huge forests. Gaul extended far beyond
the limits of modern France‚ including a large part of
Switzerland, Alsace‚ Lorraine, and the Rhenish Provinces,
