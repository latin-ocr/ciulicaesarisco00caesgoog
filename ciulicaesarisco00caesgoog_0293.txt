not have been less than t-wo miles. The cam then would have
covered an area of 160 acres—one·fou1th o a square mile—
which is very much too large for a sin le legion. See, how-
ever, the note on ξ 6 (contabulantur). aesars narrative was
of course based upon the report of Cicero ; but Ι suspect that
the e ration, if there is one, is due to a copyist, for to
falsify t e number of the towers would hardly have increased
the glory of the defence (0. G„ pp. 250-1). stms,—wooden
towers, from the stories of which archers, elingers,and artillery
showered missiles amon the defendere of a besieged town, or,
as in this case, among e assailants of a cam . When they
were mounted u on an ayyer, or siege terraee (οἵ ii, 30, ἐξ 3—4),
they were move on rollers. Occaslonally they were very high,
containing as many as ten stories (viii, 41, 5).

1895, p. 807) is right in placin it after excitantur, ut Ι cannot
accept his reason, which imp ies that Caesar preferred sound
to sense.

6. muntium pilorums-heavy pikes, hurled from walls or

towers. Cf. vii, 82, ᾗ 1.

were connected by platforms (see viii, 9, 3 and the note on
vii, 22, ᾗ 3); and if so, the number (CX may be true. But
this conjecture is not supported by the word contabulantur: in
Livy, xxiv, 34, ξ 7 turres) contabulatas can only mean ⁴ furnished
