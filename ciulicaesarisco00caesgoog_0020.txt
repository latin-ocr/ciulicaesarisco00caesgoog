xiv THE TEXT OF THE COMMENTARIES

There is also a considerable number of passages in
which, though all the manuscripts agree, the text is
obviously wrong, and has been corrected with more or
less success, Some of these emendations are certainly
right. For instance, in i, 40, ξ 9 the MS. reading is
(cui rationi contra homines barbaros . . . locus fuisset]
ac (ne ipsum quidem sperare nostros exercitus capi posse) 3
and the obvious correction, hac, appeared just four cen-
turies ago in the Aldine edition. Again‚ in vii, 3, § 2 the
MSS. have (Nam) ubique (maior atque inlustrior incidit reS,
clamore . . . significant): the emendation ubi quae is sslf-
evident. Other emendations are highly probable; and
fortunately those doubtful or corrupt passages which are
important sor history are very few.

In this book it would be useless to give a list of the
various readings of the manuscripts, or to explain in all
cases the reasons that have led me to adopt one reading ¹
in preference to another. I have briefly discussed in
{bot-notes all the more important passages in which the
text is uncertain3 but in regard to comparatively unim-
portant variations, where 1 have either been convinced
by Meusel’s arguments or those of other scholare, or
have independently come to the same conclusion, 1 have
not here stated the reasons: they are to be found in articles
to which 1 refer below.² Readers of the critical notes will
see that when 1 enclose a word or a passage in the text
in square bracketS, 1 do not necessarily mean more than

¹ Teachers and other readers who may be interested in textual
questions will find a full apparatus criticus in H. Meusel's edition of
1894, which is supplemented by an article contributed by the pre-
sent editor to the Classical Quanerly of J uly, 1911. Α list of articles
which may be consulted with profit will be found in Caesar-’s Conquest
qs Gaul, p. 202 ; and others will be referred to in my root-note&
Every one who wishes to make a special study of the commentari&
from the linguistic point of view should read Meusel’s paper in
Jahresberichte des philoloyischen Vereins zu Berlin, 1894, pp. 214-398, and
Professor Postgate's in the Classical Review, 1903, pp. 441-6. 1

² See the preceding note. In the Classical Heriem, 1901, p. 176, 12
have given reasons for preferring in many places the reading of β,1
Nipperdey rated this group very low, partly perhaps because he was
ignorant of h and l and in his time a had not been accuratelyl
collated; but even he was often obliged to have recourse to β.1
It must not, however, be imagined that those scholars who have
vindicated the independent worth of β undervalue α.
