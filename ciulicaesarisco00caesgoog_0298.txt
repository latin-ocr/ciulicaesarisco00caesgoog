convertit [, illum veruto transfixum arbitrantur}

11 Vorenus gladio rem comminus gerit atque uno inter-

12 fecto reliquos paulum propellit ; dum cupidius instat,

13 in locum delatus inferiorem concidit. Huic rursus
circumvento subsidium fert Pullo, atque ambo inco· 5

lumes compluribus interfectis summa cum laude sese

14 intra munitiones recipiunt. Sic fortuna in contentione

et certamine utrumque versavit, ut alter alteri inimi·

cus auxilio salutique esset neque diiudicari posset, uter
utri virtute anteferendus videretur. 10

A Gallio 45 Quanto erat in dies gravior atque asperior oppu-

slavo gnatio, et maxime quod magna parte militum confecta

§ 10. illum . . . arbitrantur. Ι follow Meusel (J. B„ 1910,
pp. 52-3) in bracketing these words. The reading of a—-ae'llum
vero obscurantur occisum-which is nonsensical, suggests that
there is something wrong. ‘ The fanciful reader’‚ says Meusel,
‘wanted to explainjthe act, which seemed to him surprising,
that the entire hostile group [omnis multitudo] turned upon
Vorenus! The preceding narrative shows that there was not
the slightest reason to suppose that Pullo was dead.

ξ 12. delatus is an emendation, proposed by W. Paul, instead
of the MS. reading, deiectus, which is hardly intelligible; for
how could Vorenus have been thr-oum down by men whom he
was pursuing‘?

ξ 14. ver-savit. How is onc to e ress the meaning—‘moved
[them] about ¹—in English *Ρ Ishou d say (⁸ Thus Fortune) made

them her puppets', &e

45,§ 1. fumum pars . . . necabatur. What, asks J. Lan e
(N. J., clv, 897, pp. 607-10), happened to the rest? Acco -
ingly he argues that quorum rs d rehensa is equivalent to
quorum deprehensorum pars. ut if a l were caught, why were
not all killed ⁸? I believe that Caesar meant what he seems to
mean, and that those who were not caught failed for various
reasons to reach him.

ξ 2. a prima obsidione. J. Lange (N. J.‚ clv, 1897, p. 612) says
that these words cannot mean either ‘at the beginning of the
blockade', which would be expressed by 'ma obsidione or
primo obsidionis tempore, or ⁴ immediately a r the beginning’‚
&c., but ‘ since the beginning ⁹, &c. He admits that the follow·
ing words do not appear to fit in with this translation ς but he
insists that the discrepancy is only apparent :- the words qm·
