44, ξ 1. qui . . . tenebatur is bracketed by Meusel (J. B.‚ 1910,

hill had been occupied by the enemy.

The reader will not be able to decide what this hill was until
he has read ἕξ 3-5. 'rhe iuquam mentioned in 3 must be
either (as in 36, ξ 2) the whole range formed by t e mountain
of Gergovia and the heights of Risolles, or, more probably, the
latter onlyz the domum eius cufi, or rather that part of it which
was wooded and nam-ow, was the Col des Goules, which 1 have
mentioned in the note on 36, ξ 2. 1 with Napoleon 111
in identifying the hill that was ‘comp etely deserted' (collem
. . . nudatum hominibus) with a hill, marked A in the plan,
which forms a part of the mass of Risolles, and is about 550 yards
south-west of the nearest part of the plateau of Gergovia.
Μ. Jullian identifies it with that part of the southern slo ve of
the mountain of Gergovia which was occupied by the allic

abandoned before he ascended the Roche Blancbe, and secondly
because he says in the next chapter (45, ξ 6) that, in consequence
of the stratagem which he devised after he saw that the collis
was abandoned, all the Gallie troops were withdrawn [from
their former positions by Vercingetorix to assist in fortifying
[the approach to Riso les and the 001 des GoulesJ. Does not
tlus show that the southern slope of Gergovia had not been
abandoned before (C. G„ p. 758-60) ⁴?

potuerat was proposed gy Meusel (J. B„ 1894, p. 348) instead
of poterat. In relative clauses which contain a statement of
