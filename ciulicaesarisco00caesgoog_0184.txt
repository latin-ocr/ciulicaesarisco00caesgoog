106 DE BELLO GALLICO

habent Veneti plurimas, quibus in Britanniam navi-
gare consuerunt, et scientia atque usu rerum nauti-
carum ceteros antecedunt et in magno impetu maris
atque aperto paucis portibus interiectis, quos tenent
ipsi, omnes fere qui eo mari uti consuerunt habent 5

2 vectigales. Ab his fit initium retinendi Silii atque

Velanii, quod per eos suos se obsides, quos Crasso

8 dedissent, recuperaturos existimabant. Horum aucto-

ritate finitimi adducti, ut sunt Gallorum subita et
repentina consilia, eadem de causa Trebium Terra- 10

drawn from these words ιε that the Veneti possessed, or were
able, owing to their naval strength, to blockade, harbours in
territory which was not theirs; for there would have heen no
point in saying that they were masters os the harbours m their
own country.

studying brevity as usual, omitted the word leqatorum, which
belonged to all the officere who were detained; and that the
sentence means ‘ They [the Veneti] were the first who detained
[envoys,—namely] Silius and Velanius ’. 1- am inclined, how-

initiative by etaining Silius and Velanius! Long objectu that
this would mean that ‘ the seizure of these men was the first of
their hostile acts ⁹. But so it was.

Besides their natural im atience of Roman rule, the Veneti
had a business-like motivo or resistance. According to Strabo
(iv, 4,§ 1), they had heard that Caesar was contemplating an
invasion of Britain 3 and they naturally determined to prevent
him from interfering with their trade. See p. l; δ’. G„ p. 873
and the note on iv, 21, ξ 4.
