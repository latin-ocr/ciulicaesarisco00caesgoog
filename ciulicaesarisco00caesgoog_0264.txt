10, ξ 1. in expeditionem misit does not mean ‘sent on an
expedition ’. ·As Schneider says, we may infer from viii, 8, ξ 3
that eoepeditio is equivalent to iter a militibus espeditis suscipien-

Roman columns : therefore, if Meusel's explanation is right² he
must have ascertained afterwards that the rear of the fugitives
was just visible to his troops at the very moment when he
himself, separated from the troops, received the news of the
shipwreck. This seems to me impossible. Meusel, however, 0
insiste that his explanation is proved by the word iam, and that
if Caesar had meant that the rearguaid of his own troops was in
sight, he would have written, not iam but tantum (only) or
etiam tum. Mr. A. G. Peskett (Ο. 12„ 1908, p. 94), who agrees
with me, remarks that ‘the omission in Latin of the (to us)
necessary qualifyin word ‘⁶ only ‘’ is easily defensible’. If this
explanation is in missible, I can only suppose that Caesar
wrote tantum, not iam (A. B„ p. 686-73 J. B., 1911, . 1933.
subsisterent. Somewhat dou tfully Ι retain the M . re ing
instead of sustinerent, the reading of the first printed edition,
which Meusel adopts. He remarks (J. B„ 1886, p. 292) that in
Caesar subsisto means ‘to halt‘ or ⁶ to stand firm ’, and is not
used of things. But Schneider is perhaps justified in saying Ι

desistere, which, following revocari, is both superfluous and out
of place. Meusel (J. B., 1910, p. 50-1; 1911, p. 100)‚remarking ν
that in itinere resistere can onpy mean ‘ to defend themselves as χ
they marched ⁹, argues that if Caesar had meant this, he would ’
have added some such phrase as si ab hostibus impetus fieret, and ί
