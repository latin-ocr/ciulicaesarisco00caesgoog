124 DE BELLO GALLIOO

deliguntur qui una cum Q. Sertorio omnes annos
fuerant summamque scientiam rei militaris habere
6 existimabantur. Hi consuetudine populi Romani loca
capere, castra munire, commeatibus nostros inter-
7 cludere instituunt. Quod ubi Crassus animadvertit, 5
suas copias propter exiguitatem non facile diduci,
hostem et vagari et vias obsidere et castris satis
praesidii relinquere, ob eam causam minus commode
frumentum commeatumque sibi supportari, in dies
hostium numerum augeri, non cunctandum existi· 1⁰

delata, ubi omnes idem sentire intellexit, posterum
diem pugnae constituit.

multitudinem et veterem belli gloriam paucitatemque

omnibus copiis exirent. Se we might say ‘ in 1870 the Germane
invaded France with a large force ⁹.

J. Lange (N. J., cxlvii, 1893, p. 361), who observes that there
is no other passage in Caesar in which auctoritas means ‘ prestige ’,
may ‘be right in conjectunng that he wrote (magna cum)
augeamgieod (see the first note on i, 7, ᾗ 1) is explained by suas
copias . . . diduci ; and the meaning is ‘When Crassus saw this,
namely, that his own force’ διο. In En lish the significance
of quod can only be suggested. ὅτε aliquit-gay ‘grassum {eflect-

Meusel is, perhaps, right in supplying et after relinquere.

formed his army in two lines because it was comparatively

if the auxiliaries had nerally been placed in the centro.
Evidently Crassus place them there because he thought that
they would fight better if they were supported and encouraged
by being near the legionaries. lt has been said that the usual
position of the auxiliarios was on the wings (see the note on i,
51, 1) ς but we do not know what ιι was in Caesar's time. He
