the balks were driven ‘not vertically‚ like ordinary piles’
(sublicae), it 16 natural to suppose that these eublicae were driven
vertically. If, 66 some commentatore believe, they had been
placed ιιι the form of a V or wedge below the bridge, they could
not have been described as cum omni opere coniunctae, and they
would have had hardly any effect ιιι checking the impact of the
water upon the balks. To plant them underneath the brid 36
was plainl yimpossible. Supposing, then, that they were vertical‚

that, alto 611311, 66 Μι. Peskett says, ‘a sublica remains a sublica
whether it is driven ιιι straight or crooked', Caesar* s language
was inconsistent and obscure; but no arrangement of vertical
piles would have fully answered his purpose. Moreover, the
words obl· e ayebamnrseem to mean that each sublica was driven
in obli qum, in which case it could not have been driven ver-
tically· if Caesar had intended to describe Mr. Kitson Olark' s
ament, would he not have said obliquo ordine ayebantur‘?
If, as [believe‚ Mr. Hall' 16 right, (q uae vim fluminis) exciperent

of the stream) by supporting the bridge. But on no theory can
excipere here mean ‘to intercept': even on Mr. Olark's the
stream would have struck the balks with undiminished force
