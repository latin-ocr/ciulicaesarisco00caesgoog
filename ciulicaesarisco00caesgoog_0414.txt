from A edincum down the lest bank of the Scine ; for otherwise
he wou d have been obliged, in order ιο reach Lutecia, to crosa
first the Scine and then the Marne; and, besides, Camulo nus
would not have been so foolish as to cross the Marne anf³ post
himself behind the marah which Caesar describes, when he need
only have drawn up his arm behind the Mal-ne itself, ιο hinder

which once entered the eine exactly opposite the eastern
extremity of the island on which Lutecia stood, is out of the

were osted behind the marsh heard that Labienus had crossed
the eine at Meclosedum (Melun , they sent a messa-ge ιο
Lutecia, ordering that the town s ould be burned, and then
marched thither themselves3 and this proves that when they
sent the messa e they were at a considerable distance from
Lutecia. The rge, which is between the Bievre and the

as in iv, 22, ξ 3; and I do not believe that he would have
thought it necessary to give the self evident information that
Labienus had brought the barges together. 'l'he meaning of
the MS. reading is of course that he made a bridge cf boats
