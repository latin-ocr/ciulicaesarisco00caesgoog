from the Massiliots for protection that gave occasion to
the wars which resulted in the formation of the Province
of Transalpine Gaul; and the natural willingness of the
Senafe to support their most faithful allies was doubtless
stimulated by the desire to secure possession of the indis·
pensable strip of coast between the Alps and the Pyre-
nees, partly also perh aps by the idea of creatin g a Greater
Italy for the growing Italian population. In 155 B.C.
the Romans stepped forward as the champions of Massilia
against the Ligurian tribes between the Maritime Alps
and the Rhene. The highlanders who inhabited the
mountains above the Riviera were crushed in a single
campaign 3 after an interval of thirty years their western
neighbourS, the Salyes, were forced to submit ; and their
seaboard, like that of the other tribes, was given to the
Massiliota. But the Romans had come to stay. The
Aedui, who dwelt in the Nivernais and western Bur-
gundy, calculated that the support of the republic would
help them to secure ascendancy over their rivals ς and by
a treaty, fraught with unforeseen issues‚ they were recog· 123 ac.
nized as Friends and Allies of the Roman people. The
Allobroges, on the other hand, whose home was between
the Lake of Geneva, the Rhene, and the Isere, refused to
surrender the king of the Salyes, who had claimed their
protection ς and Bituitus, King of the Arverni, with all 121 ac.
the hosts of his dependent tribes, marched to support
them. Just twenty years before the birth of Caesar a
great battle was fought at the confluence of the Rhene
and the Isere.¹ The Gauls were beaten ς and the bridges
over the Rhene broke down beneath the multitude of the
fugitives.

This victory was, in the strictest sense, decisive. The
Romans were now masters of the lower Rhone; and if
they were ever to penetrate into Further Gaul, their base
could be advanced some hundreda of miles, The Arverni,
whose power had extended to the Rhine and the Mediter- †

ranean, had received a blow from which they never
recovered.

¹ M. Jullian (Η. G„ iii, 17, n. 4), rejecting the tradition, argues
that the battle took place on the Rhene at Pont-St. Esprit.
