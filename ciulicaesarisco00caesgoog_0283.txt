COMMENTARIUS V 201

quod repentinae Gallorum coniurationi resistere non
potuerit. Id se facile ex humilitate sua probare posse,
quod non adeo sit imperitus rerum ut suis copiis
populum Romanum superari posse confidat. Sed esse 5
5 Galliae commune consilium: omnibus hibernis Caesaris
oppugnandis hunc esse dictum diem, ne qua legio
alteri legioni subsidio venire posset. Non facile 6
Gallos Gallis negare potuisse, praesertim cum de re-
cuperanda communi libertate consilium initum videre-

to act on their own initiative ¹, διο. Perhaps they are: but if
30, the case of Ambiorix was the exception that proves the rule;
and I am not quite sure that multitudo here means the whole
‘ multitude’ of Ambiorix’s host. Perhaps it only means the
‘knights’ or influential landowners (vl, 13, ξ 3 ancl their
retainers; for in vii, 63, ξ 6 multitudinis can on y bear this
meaning. In viii, 8, ξ 3 (consilio advocato . . . animos multitu·
dinis confimat) multitudo plainly denotes only the officers who

truth (C. G.. pp. 529-41, and especially pp. 532-3, 536-7).

ξ 4. potuerit, sa s Meusel (J. B.‚ 1894, pp. 364—5), is very
surprislng, for it fo lows five secondary tenses of the subjunctive
(liberatus esset, δια), and immediatel follows a perfect infini-
tive,—fuisse. ⁸ 1 can only suppose ³, e says, ‘ that quod-clauses
of this kind, which do not depend upon the principal sentence,
could be treated like inde ndent relative clauses in Oratio
Obliqua,’ in which, as in ξ , Caesar frequently uses the perfect
subjunctive even when secondary tenses of the subjunctive
precede and follow. Ι confess that I see nothing surprising in
potuerit. Meusel ap arently for ets that it is preceded by
fecerit (ξ 3), and Ι gave no dou t that in both case-s Caesar
used the primary tense because Amblonx was descnbing what
had only just happened, whereas in ξ 2 he described what had
happened some time before. Cf. ii, 4, §§ 2, 4.
