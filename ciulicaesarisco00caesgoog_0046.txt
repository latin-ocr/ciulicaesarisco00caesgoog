Years passed away. Rome became mistress of the
peninsula, and determined to vindicate her natural right
to the rich plain on her own side of the Alpine barrier.
The Gauls offered a strenuous resistance, and even
assumed the offensive. Reinforced by a swarm of free-
lances from the valley of the upper Rhone, they boldly
crossed the Apennines and plundered Etruria. The
Romans were taken by surprise ε but in the great battle
of Telamon they checked the invasion; and within two
years they fought their way to the right bank of the Po.
The Insubres on the northern side still held out: but
before the outbreak of the second Punic war Mediolanum,
or Milan, their chief stronghold, was captured; and the
for-tresses of Placentia and Cremona were founded.

But the work of conquest was only half completed
when Hannibal descended into the plain, and the exas-
perated Gauls rallied round him. When Rome emerged,
victorious, from her great struggle, they knew what was
in store for them, and made a last attempt to win back
their liberty. Placentia was sacked, and Cremona was
invested. The Roman army which marched to its relies
gained a victory, but was in its turn almost annihilated
by the Insubres· The GauIS, however, could never long
act together: their countrymen beyond the Alps gave
them no help ε the league of the northern tribes was rent
by discord and treachery 3 and the Insubres and Ceno·
mani were compelled to accept a peace, which allowed
them indeed to retain their constitution, but forbade
thern to acquire the Roman citizenship. South of the Po
the Boi strove frantically to hold their own: but in a
series of battles their fighting men were wellnigh exter·
minated: the Romans insisted upon the cession of half
their territory; and on both sides of the river the sur-
vivors were gradually lost among Italian settlers.

Eastward and southward and westward the empire of
the Romans spread. They conquered Greece. They
conquered Carthage. They conquered Spain. But be-
tween the central and the western peninsula they had no
means of communication by land save what was afforded
by the Greek colony of Massilia. It was an entreaty
