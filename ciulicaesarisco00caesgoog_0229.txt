ξ 4. profectum is the reading of φτ χ β have perfectum, and
as this appears not only in β but also in one family of a, it
was evidently the reading of the archetype. Klotz, however
(C.S., p. 251 , objecting that neither of the two readings
informs us w ose laus and utilitas were promoted, suggests
that profectum was due to the mistake of a copyist who mis-
understood the abbreviation p. ro. (populi Romani), and that
what Caesar wrote was populi Romam· factum. Meusel (B. ph. W„
1911, ool. 14οὲ who accepts the more important art of this
emendation, o serves that with sactum Caesar wou d not have
written ad laudem et ad utilitatem, but laudi et utilitati, or else
the gerundive. Klotz's conjecture is ingenious; but his reason
sor reJecting the MS. readings does not convince me. Read this
translation and see whether it does not express what Caesar may
have said: ‘he felt that honour was satisfled and that he had
lalerved every useful purpose.’ Why should he have said whose

onour?

20, §2. anni. Meusel (J. B.. 1910, p. 64) gives the obvious
reason for rejecting this word. lt seems very unlikely‚ however,
that any reader would have written anni on the margin of his
copy, and when Ι read 22, ξ 2, vii, 32, §2 (cum ipso anni tempore
ad ymndum bellum vocaretur), and vii, 68, § 2 (quantum diei
tempus est passum), 1 am inclined to think that the word may be
reasonably defended. Could not one say ‘even if the season of
the year did not serve for campaigning ’ ⁴? Cf. L. 0., i, 271.

§ 3. It would be a mistake to translate temere by ⁴ rashly’:
it means ‘readil ‘ or ‘as an ordinary affair ’. Students of
Druidism did un ertake the ‚journey (vi, 13, ἕξ 11-12), but not
temere: they had a serious object in view.
