that Caesar had wished to say that he made a forced march
which did not take him the whole way to Noviodunum, and
that on the following day he pushed on for Noviodunum, would
not the words maqno itinere consecto ad ο idum Noviodunum
contendit have expressed his meaning?’ o ς for in the case
supposed he would have written (ma o itinere confecto)
proximo (or altero or postero die (ad oppigdlm, δια).

It is generally assumed t at the startingpoint of this forced
march was Caesar’s camp on the Aisne (5, ξ 4): if so, the
length of the march was about 28 miles if he encamped
on the hill of Manchamp; about 24 miles if he encamped on
the plateau of Chaudardes (see the article on Noviodunum

p. 426-71). The assumption, however, seems to me doubtful.

he force which Caesar had detached in pursuit of the
Belgae ‘ returned, in obedience to orders, to camp' (11,§ 6).
Consider whatis involved in the supposition that they returned
to the camp mentioned in 5, § 4. 1f their puisuit had been ⁴
directed down the valley of the Aisne, they were obl' ed, aster
an extraordinarily long day's work and immediate y before
another rodigious march, to return the whole distance which
they h covered between dawn and sunset; while Caesar,
although he was anxious to reach Noviodunum as soon as pos-
sible, needlessly imposed this heav'y labour upon them, and

likely that, instead of fitting idle in camp, he marched down
the valley to within a short distance of the frontier of the Sues-
siones? ·

But why did he order the detachment to return at all *Ρ 1f
the pursuit was directed down the valley, along which he was
himself about to march, this question cannotbe answered3 but
if, on the other hand, the Suessiones fied northward down the
road towards Laon, to fetch ge which they may have lest,
at the place where the Belgae ad concentrated (5, § 4), the
answer is obvious. While Caesar moved a few miles down the
valley, and thus shortened the inevitable maynum iter, the do-
tachment rejoined him (by a road leading to Beaurieux Ῥ). It
has, indeed, been suggested that the various Belgic contingente
dis ersed at the very beginning of their ssight, the Bellovaci
andJ Suessiones moving down the valle on the heights parallel
with the right bank of the river, an all the others towards
Laon. But if so, how could the Suessiones have failed to detect
that Caesar in the valley below was overtaking and outstrip·
