night of the 6th of July (of the Julian calendar)—the date
on which, as we may infer from Cicero’s correspondence, Caesar
most probably sailed (A. B., pp. 728-30)—the stream began to
run up the Channel about ten o'clock; for it turned westward

about and run down with the stream. If the eb tide had
served throughout, it would not have been necessary to row
hard in order that the whole fleet should reach Britain before
noon. In A. Β., pp. 655-9‚ I have shown that so long as it was

ossible to follow the tide, the work of the rowers was easy,

Sand Head Light Vessel is moored, the ships* heads were turned
in the direction of Sandwich, they encountered a eroes-current
setting towards the south-west.

ut . . . coynovemt does not necessarily mean that Caesar
intended to land at exactly the same place at which 110 had
landed in the preceding year. See the first note on 9, 1.

Meusel (J. Β., 1894, p. 377) rejects, because Caesar rarely‚ if
ever, uses the form ·arunt (the very few assages 111 which
the MSS. present this form are not improbab y corrupt): β 1100
adaequaverint, which is rather suspicions, because Caesar nowhere
else uses the erfect subjunctive in causal relative sentences.
Accordingly eusel conjectures that he wrote adaequaverunt.
