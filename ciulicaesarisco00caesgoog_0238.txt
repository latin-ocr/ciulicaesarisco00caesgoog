156 DE BELLO GALLICO

ventum et aestum uno tempore nactus secuudum,
dato signo et sublatis ancoris, circiter milia passuum

is about 52 nautical miles from the mouth of the Somme,
where, according to Airy‚ Caesar embarked; while Boulogne,
from which, as we have seen, he really sailed, is only 27 nautical
miles from Dover. Secondly, in the neighbourhood of Pevensey
the mordes off which Caesar anchored (23, ξ 3) do not exist:
Airy was forced to identify them with what he himself describes
as eliffs ‘ten to thirty feet high ’ 2 Thirdly, Airy himself, who
knew all that was to be known about the tides, and who main·
tained that Caesar sailed from his anchorago ιο 1116 landing
place 011 the westward stream, was obliged ιο admit that 116
0011111 11οι 11816 done so unless, when he anchored‚ 116 11811 116611
5 nautical miles from the coast! From this distance he could
not have seen the Britons 011 ι116 cliffs (23, §2) without a
telescope‚ and even the ridiculous cliffs, ‘ ten to thirty feet high:
could not have been distinguished. Fourthly, Caesar sailed for
Britain in 54 B.c. with a south-west wind (1, 8, ξ 2); 81111 ιο
6811 for Pevensey from either Boulogne or Wissant (see the note
on 22, ξ 4) or even from the Somme with a south-west wind
would have been sheer folly. LastIy, Caesar says (v, 23, § 6)
ι118ι 111 54 Β. c. he started 011 his voyage from Britain to Gaul
‘at the beginning of the second watch’ in ‘a dead calm '
(summa tranquillitate)‚—in other words, his ships, which 111 ι118ι
year were built both for rowing and sailing (v, 1, § 3), were
rowed3 116 reached laud at dawn; and to row 52 nautical miles
in 8 hours was, needless to say, impossible. Several other reasons
could be given; but these are enough.

Lympne and Hythe must also be iejected. It 1186 116611
calculated that the tidal stream had been running westward
for several hours before the end of the ninth 110111· (666 23, § 4):
therefore, su posing that Caesar sailed from his anchorage
westward, 81111166 116 0011111 11816 estimated the exact time which
the stream had still to run he would have had to face the risk
that, before 116 could rea-ch his landing-place‚ it might turn
against him. His own words (et ventum et aestum uno tempore
nactus secundum) show that he weighed anchor 'ust after the
stream had turned (eastward). He implies (26, ξ] 5) that if 116
11811 had his cavalry with him, he would have been able to make
good 1166 of them ; 1111ι what would have been the use of sending
cavalry up the steep slopes 011 which stand the ruins of Stutfall
Castle 01 over the wooded heights which extended behind
Hythe *Ρ Worse round for the manoeuvring of cavalry it
would have been ard for Volusenus to find. It would have
been impossible for the cavalry transports of which 1 have
spoken in the note on 22, §4 to return from anywhere near
Lympne or Hythe to Ambleteuse; and it would have been very
difficult, if not impossible, to sail from Boulogne to Lympne or
even to Hythe with a south-west wind. Furthermore, an episode
which Caesar describes in ch. 32 is inexplicable on the theory
that he landed at either of those places. He says that one
day, when the 7th legion had ne out to cut corn, he learned
from the troops on guard 111 ‘ront of his camp that an extra·
ordinary quantity of dust was visible in the direction in which
