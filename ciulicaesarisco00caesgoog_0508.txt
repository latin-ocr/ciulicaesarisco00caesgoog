the fifth century and migrated to Laon; that emigrante from
Laon in their turn built a town upon the site of Bebrieux and
named it after Bibrax, which their forefathers had inhabited ;
and that the name Bibmx was given to Laon because the in-
habitants of the old Bibrax had migrated to it. Napoleon 111
observes, further, that Vieux·Laon‚ on its southern side, was
unassailable by the Gallie method of assault (6, §f§ 2-3): and
he argues that the Belgae, with the carelessness o a half-bar·
barous people‚ would have neglected to invest it on that side
(C. G„ pp. 398-400).

Bratuspantium cannot be identified with certainty. We
only know that it was on or near the road by which Caesar
marched from Noviodunum, which was almost certainly on the
hill of Pommiers, about 2} miles north—west of Soissons, into
the country of the Ambiani, whose chief town was Samarobriva
(Amiens); and that it was not the same as Caesaromagus
(Beauvais), the Gallo-Roman capital of the Bellovaci, which
was built on virgin soil. It would be useless to mention here
all the sites that have been proposed. There is something to
be said for Breteuil‚ which is on a strong position near the
Roman road from Soissons to Amiens, and close to which, in
the valley of Vandeuil‚ a few Gallic and numerous Gallo-Roman
antiquities have been found3 but a French antiquary, Dr. V.
Leblond‚ who has explored every yard of the country that be·
longed to the Bellovaci, prefers Hom-Cesar, between 6 and 7
miles ESE. of Beauvais. The hill is perfectly suitable for a
stronghold ε but it is about 251 feet above the plain; and this
seems hardly consistent with Caesar’s statement that when he

begged the Romans for peace’ (ii, 13, ξ 3). I have marked
Bratuspantium on the map on the site of Breteuil‚ but with
a note of interrogation (0. 0., pp. 400-2).

Cadurci.—The territory of the Cadurci corresponded with
the diocese of Cahom, which preserves their name, in other
words with the department of the Lot. In the last
(vii, 75, ξ 2) in which Caesar mentions them we find the words
Eleutetis cadurcis or, accordin to the group of MSS. known as
φ, Heleutetae's et cadurcis. It fias been supposed that Ele-uteri,
like Aulon-ci, was a name common to several tribes3 but if so,
why was it not applied by any ancient writer to any other tribe
besides the Cadurci ἱ) It has also been suggested that Eleutetos was
the Celtic equivalent of the Greek ἐλεύθερος, ‘ free ⁹, and accord-
ingly that the Eleuteti Cadurci were independent, while the rest
of the Cadurci were already under Roman rule. But if so, the
