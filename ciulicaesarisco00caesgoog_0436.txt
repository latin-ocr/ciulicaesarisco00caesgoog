344 DE BELLO GALLICO

deponents, would be awkward3 (2) that Caesar has already
stated that the munitiones were made; and (3) that if copiis is
ablative (as, after fieri, it ought to be), necesse is too far from
Εναες it is doubtful whether the ablative is instrumental or
absolute; and if it is the latter, whether it is causal or con·
' cessive. These reasons leave me uneonvinced3 and Heller
(Pla, 1872, pp. 524-5) successfully defends fieri. He says that
in what precedes Caesar does not refer to entrenchments which
were already made but to entrenchments which were being
made [in other words, having described in ch. 72 the con·
struction of the entrenchments, he now shows what happened
while they were being constructed12 the difficulty os making
them was increased by the fact that· the soragers had to go
long distances³ but for the difficulty of defending them it
mattered nothing whether the distances were long or short.
Moreover, if Caesar had written tueri, he would not have naid ac
(non numquam . . . conabantur) but cum (non numquam . . . cona-
rentur, &c.). Heller gives other good reasons for rejecting
Schneider's emendation.

ξ 2. perpetuae does not mean that the trenches formed a ring
round Alesia, for they were not wanted everywhere (see the note
on Fossam . . . duxit [72, ξ 1]), but only that in the places where
they were necessa they were continuous (C. G„ . 811).

which the excavatlons do not enable us to answer. Did Caesar
mean that there were five rallel trenches, or five rows of
boughs in each trench? I elieve that he meant the latter,
because if he had meant that there were flve perpetuae fossae,
he would surely have said so when he first mentioned these
trenches, in ξ 2; and, moreover, by planting five rows os
