the recall of the legions as a sign of fear; but I agree with
Meusel that the passage is suspicions. See A. B.‚ pp. 687-8.

ᾗ 2. litterasque. β 0111116 que. Meusel (J. B.‚ 1910, p. 382
thinks that a reader who took nuntiis in the sense of ‘ messages
(not ⁶ messengers ¹) wrote litteris in the margin or above nuntiis
by way of explanation, and that the writer of the archetype
of a added que to make sense. Accordingly Meusel deletes
litteris, remarkin that Atrius would not have wasted time
in writing a ful report. Granted3 but such a report as
Caesar has himself given in 10, ξ 2-3 could have been written
in 3 minutes; and it is not impro able that Atrius wrote it and
that the messengers gave fuller details orally. Sti11‚12·eterae·sque
ἴε ἳᾷἳῃ ii} suspsscithur· 1 am inclined to believe that Meusel
1s ng t 111 conJectunng that Caesar wrote reliquae refici posse,
mayno tamen neqotio viderentur. 1f the MS. reading is right,
tamen is dused, as‘int i, 32, §t 5, in wgiat its called a concessive
sense, an means a any ra e or ‘a eas '.

ξ 3. fabrus. See p. lxiv and C. G„ p. 579.

deligit. β has deliqi. Meusel (J. Β., 1894, p. 339) says that if
Caesar returned with the legions to the fleet, deliyit is probable3
but that if 116 returned alone, deliqi is necessary. Sui-ely not,
is, as is likely, the legions returned in the course of the day.
Caesar certainly returned alone3 for even if the words atque in
itinere vesistere (ξ 1) are spurious, ipse . . . revertitur shows that
he did not wait or the 16 ‘ons.

ξ 4. naves instituat. hese ships were undoubtedly built
in the dockyards at Gesoriacum (Boul ne); for there could
have been no appliances for ship-buiffing at Wissant. But
this is not enough to prove that Labienus’s camp was at
Bopgxgne, though most probably it was (Α.Β., p. 5843 C. 0.,
p ξ 6.) Schneider apparently takes ad as equivalent to quod
attinet ad (⁴as regards'): I believe with Meusel (L. C„ i, 138)
that its force is final, and that the litei-al meaning is ‘ not even
the hours of night being lest out with a view to’·— that is,
‘which could be devoted to'-(the work). We should say
⁶ the troops not suspending work even in the night ⁹.
