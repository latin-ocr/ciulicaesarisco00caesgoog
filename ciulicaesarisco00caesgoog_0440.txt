348 DE BELLO GALLICO

76 Huius opera Commii, ut antea demonstravimus,
fideli atque utili superioribus annis erat usus in Bri-
tannia Caesar3 pro quibus meritis civitatem eius
immunem esse iusserat, iura legesque reddiderat atque

2 ipsi Morinos attribuerat. Tanta tamen universae Gal· ε
liae consensio fuit libertatis vindicandae et pristinae
belli laudis recuperandae, ut neque beneficiis neque
amicitiae memoria moverentur, omnesque et animo

3 et opibus in id bellum incumberent. Coactis equitum
milibus VIII et peditum circiter CCL, haec in Hae-1⁰
duorum finibus recensebantur, numerusque inibatur,

immunem. It is uncertain whether the burden from which
the Atrebates were released was that of paying tribute to Caesar,
or of paying tribute to some stronger Bel ic tribe, or of supply·
ing Caesar's army with corn (0. G„ pp. 133, n. 2, 838 .

Remi (ιί, 3, 5), had been subject to some other tribe 3 and uf so,
Caesar may ave meant that he had restored their independence.

§pff nmrerentur. I retain the MS. reading doubtfull . Meusel
(J. Β., 1886, p. 290) adopts the emendation moveretur, e subject
of which he takes to be not Gallia but Commius. He argues
(1) that morerentur would have no definite subject, (2) that
Caesar would not have said that the Gauls were all in-
debted to him for favour-s, (¹33 that if nacon-emur represented
what Caesar meant, he wou have written, say, ut nemo aut
beneficiis aut amicitiae memoria moventur, and (4) that tamen
shows that the following words contain a special reference to
Commius. It seems to me, on the other hand, that if moveretur
were the right reading and Commius were the subject, the
‘ special reference ⁹ to Commius would be, so to speak, awkwardly
sandwiched in, and that the passage, as it stands, does contain
a reference to Commius, who is surely included under omnes.
It is not surprising that moveantur· has no definite subject, for
in iv, 33, § 1 perequitant and in vi, 34, 5 venem—the reading
which Meusel ado ts-have none 3 and ere are other instances
in v, 40,§ 1, vi, 9, 2, and vii, 79, ᾗ 3. However, though Meusel’s
arguments do not seem to me quite stroffi enough to justify us
in rejecting the MS. reading, I freely mit that he may be
ri ht3 only, if Caesar wrote moventur, I should say that its
su ject was Gallia.
