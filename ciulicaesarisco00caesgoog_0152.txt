76 DE BELLO GALLICO

fossas castella constituit ibique tormenta conlocavit,

quas proxime conscripserat in castris relictis ut, si

ξ 3. iv? fronte. The reading of a, which J. Η. Schmalz (N. J.,
clv, 1897, pp. 211-12) defends, is in frontem: but Caesar could
not have wntten in frontem unless he had been thinking of the
ascent of the hill from south to north 3 and that he had already

tormenta. Neither ballistae nor catapultae are mentioned in
the Bellum Gallicum: but both are perhaps included under
the name commem and as that name, which is derived from
to o, suggests, both derived their power from the recoil of
tig tly twrsted cordage. The Roman were probably inferior to
the Greek, on the pattern of which they were modelled; for
Caesar's artillery was no match for that of the Massiliots (B.C'.‚
ii, 2, ξ 5ς 9, ξ 3): but the best Greek engines must have been
nearly, if not quite, as effective as the cannon of the Middle
Ages. The Greek writer Agesistratus says that a range of over
800 yards was occasionally attained3 and Sir Ralph Payne-
Gallwey has constructed a comparatively small machine which
threw a stone ball weighing eight pounds nearly 500 yar-ds. lt
is impossible to state exactly what the difference between cata-
pults and ballistae was; but both resembled huge crossbows, the
main difference being that instead of one bow there were two
arms„ connected by a rope which formed the bowstring3 and
both catapult and ballista could dischar e either heavy stones
or feathered javelins (C. G„ pp. 582—3). {ee p. 440.
