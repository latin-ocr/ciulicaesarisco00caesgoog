xxxviii DISCOVERY OF CAESARE CAMPS

(see p. 305)]. There the layer of productive soil, at the
most 50 or 60 centimetres thick (if my memory is good),
lies upon a caleareous subsoil as hard and white as

 

chalk: the ditches of the camp, filled with a mixture
of productive soil and c-halk, presented outlines which
stood out against the earth by which they were surrounded‚
as sharply as the annexed triangle ABG on the white

paper?
