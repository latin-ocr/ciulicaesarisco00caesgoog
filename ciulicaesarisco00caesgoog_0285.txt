COMMENTARIUS V 203

turpius quam auctore hoste de summis rebus capere
consilium ’ὃ

Contra ea Titurius sero facturos clamitabat, cum 29
maiores manus hostium adiunctis Germanis conve-
5 nissent, aut cum aliquid calamitatis in proximis
hibernis esset acceptum. Brevem consulendi esse
occasionem. Caesarem arbitrari profectum in Italiam 3 2
neque aliter Carnutes interficiundi Tasgetii consilium
fuisse capturos neque EburoneS, si ille adesset, tanta
10 contemptione nostri ad castra venturos. Sese non 3
hostem auctorem sed rem spectare: subesse Rhenum3
magno esse Germanis dolori Ariovisti mortem et
superiores nostras victorias3 ardere Galliam tot con· 4
tumeliis acceptis sub populi Romani imperium redac-
15 tam, superiore gloria rei militaris extincta. Postremo 5
quis hoc sibi persuaderet sine certa spe Ambiorigem
ad eius modi consilium descendisse? Suam sententiam 6
in utramque partem esse tutam: si nihil esset durius,
nullo cum periculo ad proximam legionem perventuros3

have framed for Oratio Obli ua. But the rule does not derive
much support from the MS . of the commentaria. The sub-
junctive is found in rhetorical questions in all the MSS. in
i‚4o‚§2; 43, ξ 8; v, 29, ἕξ 5—7; and B.C., i, 32, ῗ 3; and in
the first and last of these passages the indicative wou d certainly
have been used in Oratio Recta.

adesset. In English one would say ‘ (if Caesar) had heen at
hand ’, and a beginner would probably wonder why he did not
write adfici-sset. But in Oratio Recta Sabinus would have said
(neque, si ille) adesset (tanta contemptione nostri ad castra)
venissent, and is in Oratio Obliqua adesset had been changed
into adfuisset, the meaning would have been ‘if Caesar had
been at hand during the attack and had afterwards departed ’.

§a Sese . . . spectum—‘It was not to the enemy that he
looked for guidance, but to facts ‘.

Ariovisti mortem. How and in what circumstances Ariovistus
was slain is not known ; but the remark which Caesar ascribes
to Sabinus oints to the conclusion that he was killed by
Roman han s. It has been suggested that he may have died
from a wound received in the battle which is described in i, 52.
