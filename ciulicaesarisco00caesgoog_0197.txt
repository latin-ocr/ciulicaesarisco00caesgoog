COMMENTARIUS III 1 19

Locus erat castrorum editus et paulatim ab imo 19

Impeditis hostibus propter ea quae ferebant onera

numerum eorum occiderunt3 reliquos equites con-
sectati paucos, qui ex fuga evaserant, reliquerunt.

15 Sic uno tempore et de navali pugna Sabinus et de 5
Sabini victoria Caesar est certior factus, civitatesque
omnes se statim Titurio dediderunt. Nam ut ad bella 6
suscipienda Gallorum alacer ac promptus est animus,

as the lie of the ground allowed, and had four gates. or rather
openings, one on each side. It seems fair to assume that duabus
portis means the right and the left gate, as the Romans would
thus have fallen upon the flanks of the panting multitude. See
Lon 's Caesar, p. 176.

§6. Nam ut . . . mens eorum est. If the reader will think,
he will discern the difference between animus and mens, as they
are used here, and he will also see that neither means quite the
same as in i, 39, ξ 1. When he has thought the matter out, he
