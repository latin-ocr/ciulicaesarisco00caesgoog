VELLAVII—-VOLCAE 435

Sos, and the Tarusates dwelt either in the district of Aire or in
the neighbouri district of Tartas. The Vocates are generally
identified with t e Boiates, who occupied the district of Buch‚
near Arcachon. But this will not do ς for Arcachon is far away
from Aire and from Tartas, whereas the Vocates were close to
the Tarusates. Whether the Vocates possessed Buch or not,
their count must have extended southward into the depart-
ment of Les andes (0. G„ pp. 500-1).

Vocontii.—The chief towns of this Alpino eople were
Vasio (Vaison), Lucus Augusti (Luc , and Dea (131³), and on
the north they were conterminous wit the Allobroges (i, 10, 5).
But it isimpossible to define their frontiers, because the terri ry
which undoubtedly belonged to them was surrounded by the
territories of minor peoplesssthe Memini, Vulgientes, QuariateS,
Bodiontici, Avanticr, Tricomi, and Ucem—whom Caesar ignores,
and who may have been pays· of theim, actually included within
their territory, or may on have been their dependants (clientes) ς
while some of these eop es may have been pays· or dependants
of the Caturi es or of the Allobroges (G. G„ pp. 501-2).

Volcae.— e Volcae (Areconnci and Tectosages) possessed
the country between the Rhene, the Cevennes‚ the upper
Garonne, and the Mediterranean. According to Strabo (ιν, 1,
ξ 12), Narbo belonged to the Arecomici3 according to Ptolemy
(Geoym ii, 10, ξ 6), to the Tectosages. A passage in B. G„ vii, 7,
ξ 4—prae3idia in Rutenis provincialibus, Volcis Arecomice‘s, T olo·
satibus, circumque Narbonem . . . constituit—seems to imply that
{lag-bo was not, at all events in 52 Β. c., in the country of the

comici.
