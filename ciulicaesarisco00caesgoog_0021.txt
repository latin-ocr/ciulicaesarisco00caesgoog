THE TEXT OF THE COMMENTARIES xv

that Ι regat-d it 88 open to suspicion, though some
bracketed words are certainly spurious. The obvious
emendationS, of which I have already given two examples,
and which, as a rule, I have adopted silently‚ will be
found in Meusel’s critical edition. The principle to which
Ι have adhered is never to incorporate an emendation in
the text, even when I am inclined to believe that it
represents what Caesar wrote, unless the MS. reading or
readings seem indefensible. When, for instance, one finds
that in vii, 10, ξ 1 eapuynatis is used in 8 sense which
the verb has nowhere else in Caesar, and never in
Cicero or in Sallust, one feels the necessity of cantion.

Nom—When 1 quote readings adopted by Meusel which are not
in hle text of 1894, they are to be found in the reissue of his school
edition (1908) unless Ι state that he has adopted them since.
