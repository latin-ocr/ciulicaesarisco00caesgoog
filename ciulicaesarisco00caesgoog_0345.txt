German critic, named Max Eichheim, who has brought 0
1001 many absurd cha 08 01 10180110011 against Caesar, asks
how 110 learned that an {turoniam captive guided the Sugambri
to Atuatuca, since not 000 01 1110 Sugambri fell into 1118 hands,
and ‘the guide could hardl have come back to him for a tip '.
Now if none of the Sugambri fell into Caesar’s hands, some of
their prisoners may have escaped; but Eichheim’s joke is not
bad, and perhaps for once he has hit a 001100 the head. Caesar
may have assumed that the Sugambri must have been guided
by some 00ος and the little speech which he puts into the
mouth 01 the guide may 11ον0 been an invention. But if it was,
such a trifle does not affect the general trustworthiness of his
narrative. Ancient historians were not scrupulous about in-
ventin speeches; but Caesar, 08 000 01 1118 0880110018 01101118,
